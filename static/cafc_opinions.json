Buffington appeals a final decision of the\n United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. Buff-\n ington v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 293 (2019) (Veterans Court\n Op.). Under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2), the Veterans Court de-\n nied Mr. Buffington an earlier effective date for recom-\n mencement of his disability benefits after periods in which\n he received active service pay. Id. at 296. Mr. Buffington\n contends \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) conflicts with and is an unreasona-\n ble interpretation of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(c). Because we hold\n \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) reasonably fills a statutory gap, we affirm.\n                       BACKGROUND\n     Mr. Buffington served on active duty in the United\n States Air Force from September 1992 until May 2000. Af-\n ter leaving active duty service, Mr. Buffington sought dis-\n ability benefits. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\n found that Mr. Buffington suffered from service-connected\n tinnitus, rated his disability at ten percent, and awarded\n\n\n     *    Chief Judge Kimberly A. Moore assumed the posi-\n tion of Chief Judge on May 22, 2021.\n\fCase: 20-1479     Document: 62      Page: 3     Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH                                     3\n\n\n\n him disability compensation. In 2003, Mr. Buffington was\n recalled to active duty in the Air National Guard. He in-\n formed the VA of his return to active service, and the VA\n discontinued his disability compensation. See 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7\u00a7 5112(b)(3), 5304(c). In 2004, Mr. Buffington completed\n his term of active service. Later that year, he was again\n recalled to active duty, serving until July 2005. It was not\n until January 2009, however, that Mr. Buffington sought\n to recommence his disability benefits. The VA determined\n Mr. Buffington was entitled to compensation effective on\n February 1, 2008\u2014one year before he sought recommence-\n ment. See 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) (setting effective date for\n recommencement of compensation, at the earliest, one year\n before filing).\n     Mr. Buffington filed a Notice of Disagreement, chal-\n lenging the VA\u2019s effective-date determination. The VA Re-\n gional Office issued a Statement of the Case rejecting his\n challenge and providing further reasoning for the February\n 1, 2008 effective date. Mr. Buffington then appealed to the\n Board of Veterans Appeals, which affirmed the VA\u2019s deci-\n sion. He next appealed to the Veterans Court. That court\n held that \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) was a valid exercise of the Secretary\n of Veterans Affairs rulemaking authority and was not in-\n consistent with 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(c). See Veterans Court\n Op., 31 Vet. App. at 300\u201304. Mr. Buffington appeals. We\n have jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a).\n                          DISCUSSION\n      Title 38 codifies a complex statutory scheme aimed at\n providing benefits to veterans. For example, it provides\n veterans with a general entitlement to compensation \u201c[f]or\n disabilit[ies] resulting from personal injur[ies] suffered . . .\n in [the] line of duty\u201d during a period of war, \u00a7 1110, or dur-\n ing peacetime, \u00a7 1131. As a shorthand, Congress refers to\n those disabilities as service-connected disabilities. See 38\n U.S.C. ch. 11 (\u201cCompensation for Service-Connected Disa-\n bility or Death\u201d). And it refers to benefits paid as a result\n\fCase: 20-1479     Document: 62     Page: 4    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 4                                 BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n of service-connected disabilities as compensation. Id.\n \u00a7 101(13). Title 38 also provides pensions for veterans who\n served in a period of war and for veterans who appear on\n the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Coast Guard Medal of Honor\n Roll. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 1511\u201325.\n      To receive disability benefits, a veteran must apply. Id.\n \u00a7 5101(a)(1)(A) (\u201c[A] specific claim in the form prescribed\n by the Secretary . . . must be filed in order for benefits to\n be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws ad-\n ministered by the Secretary.\u201d). Based on that application,\n the VA must determine whether the veteran has a general\n entitlement to disability benefits\u2014for example, because he\n has a service-connected disability. If a veteran has a ser-\n vice-connected disability, the VA must assign him a disa-\n bility rating, which corresponds to the amount of\n compensation paid. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 1134 (setting rates of\n peacetime disability compensation by reference to \u00a7 1114,\n which sets those rates for wartime disability). It must also\n set the effective date for the award of benefits. Id. \u00a7 5110.\n Occasionally, under the statutory framework, benefits\n must be reduced or discontinued. When a veteran returns\n to active service, for example, he cannot receive both active\n service pay and disability compensation. Id. \u00a7 5304(c).\n When a reduction or discontinuance is in order, \u00a7 5112 dic-\n tates how the VA must determine the effective date for that\n reduction or discontinuance.\n     This appeal requires us to interpret VA-administered\n statutes to determine the effective date for recommencing\n (as opposed to awarding or discontinuing) service-con-\n nected disability benefits once a veteran leaves active ser-\n vice. 1 The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has answered that\n\n\n     1   Mr. Buffington argues the question at issue should\n be framed as whether the VA can effect a forfeiture of ben-\n efits. But that framing assumes the interpretive conclu-\n sion.\n\fCase: 20-1479     Document: 62      Page: 5     Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH                                     5\n\n\n\n interpretive question, promulgating 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2)\n through notice-and-comment rulemaking. In such circum-\n stances, we apply the two-step framework set forth in\n Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\n Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). 2 Step one asks \u201cwhether Con-\n gress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d\n Id. at 842. \u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that is the\n end of the matter,\u201d and we \u201cmust give effect to the unam-\n biguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d Id. at 842\u201343. If,\n however, \u201cthe statute is silent or ambiguous with respect\n to the specific issue,\u201d we proceed to step two of the Chevron\n framework, at which we determine \u201cwhether the agency\u2019s\n answer is based on a permissible construction of the stat-\n ute.\u201d Id. at 843. We must defer in the face of statutory\n silence because, \u201cas a general rule, agencies have authority\n to fill gaps where the statutes are silent.\u201d Nat\u2019l Cable &\n Telecom. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 534 U.S. 327, 339\n (2002) (citing Chevron, 467 U.S. 843\u201344); see also Cana-\n dian Solar, Inc. v. United States, 918 F.3d 909, 917 (Fed.\n Cir. 2019).\n                                I\n     At step one, we hold that Congress left a gap in the\n statutory scheme. Section 5304(c) bars duplicative com-\n pensation when a veteran receives active service pay:\n     Pension, compensation, or retirement pay on ac-\n     count of any person\u2019s own service shall not be paid\n     to such person for any period for which such person\n     receives active service pay.\n\n\n\n     2      Amicus New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) ar-\n gues the Chevron framework should not apply. Neither\n party adopts this position, see Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7 (\u201cThis\n question is governed by the two-step framework of Chevron\n . . . .\u201d) and Appellee\u2019s Brief at 12, and we do not find it per-\n suasive given the facts and arguments presented here.\n\fCase: 20-1479     Document: 62     Page: 6    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 6                                 BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(c). Thus, a veteran cannot receive both\n service-connected disability payments and active service\n pay. And Congress set the effective date (start date) for\n discontinuing disability benefits based on active service:\n     The effective date of a reduction or discontinuance\n     of compensation . . . by reason of receipt of active\n     service pay or retirement pay shall be the day be-\n     fore the date such pay began.\n 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5112(b)(3). But Congress did not establish\n when or under what conditions compensation recom-\n mences once a disabled veteran leaves active service. No-\n where in \u00a7 5304(c)\u2019s plain terms or in the broader statutory\n structure did Congress speak directly to that issue.\n      The \u201cany period\u201d phrase in \u00a7 5304(c) does not set the\n effective date for recommencing disability benefits. Of\n course, the word period refers to a length of time: here, the\n time during which a veteran is receiving active service pay.\n And that period has a beginning date\u2014when active service\n compensation starts\u2014and an end date\u2014when active ser-\n vice compensation ends. But \u00a7 5304(c) does not say com-\n pensation must cease only for that period. Congress was\n silent regarding whether other conditions, such as timely\n filing of an application, could justify a later effective date\n for any recommencement of compensation. Congress nei-\n ther required nor prohibited consideration of such condi-\n tions. And we must not read into \u00a7 5304(c) words that\n Congress did not enact\u2014like reading \u201cany period\u201d as \u201conly\n any period.\u201d See Bates v. United States, 522 U.S. 23, 29\n (1997) (\u201c[W]e ordinarily resist reading words or elements\n into a statute that do not appear on its face.\u201d).\n     Mr. Buffington argues, relying on statutory context,\n that his interpretation does not read \u201conly\u201d (or any other\n language) into \u00a7 5304(c). He claims Title 38 obligates the\n VA to pay compensation for service-connected disabilities,\n\fCase: 20-1479     Document: 62      Page: 7    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH                                    7\n\n\n\n see 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131; 3 sets the effective date for those\n awards, see id. \u00a7 5110; and provides a limited exception for\n when payment is barred based on active service pay, see id.\n \u00a7 5304(c). Thus, to Mr. Buffington, \u201ccompensation runs\n parallel to the period of service: stopping on re-entry to ac-\n tive military service and restarting at discharge from ac-\n tive military service.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 14\u201315\n (internal quotation marks omitted).\n     Mr. Buffington\u2019s concessions throughout this case,\n however, undermine that position. In his opening brief,\n Mr. Buffington agreed the VA can \u201crequire that a veteran\n notify it that the veteran is no longer receiving active duty\n pay before benefits can be paid.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 32 (em-\n phasis in original). That is, the VA can require a veteran\n to apply for recommencement of disability benefits. See 38\n C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) (creating just such a requirement).\n And at argument, Mr. Buffington went further. Ques-\n tioned about Mr. Buffington\u2019s admissions in his briefing,\n Mr. Buffington\u2019s counsel conceded that \u201cthe government\n can certainly require reapplication[,] . . . can require a vet-\n eran to appear for an additional medical exam[, and] . . .\n can reconsider the amount of disability compensation.\u201d See\n Oral Arg. 4 at 4:50\u20135:45. Implicit in that view is the under-\n standing that \u00a7 5304(c) does not create a limited exception\n to a general entitlement to benefits. Instead, when a disa-\n bled veteran returns to active service, his disability bene-\n fits are discontinued. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5112 (setting\n\n\n\n     3   Mr. Buffington cites 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 for his gen-\n eral entitlement to compensation, which relates to wartime\n disabilities. But because Mr. Buffington did not serve dur-\n ing a period of war, id. \u00a7 1101(2), a different provision con-\n trols. See id. \u00a7 1131. Still, any differences between \u00a7\u00a7 1110\n and 1131 are immaterial for purposes of this appeal.\n     4   Available      at           http:\/\/oralarguments.cafc.\n uscourts.gov\/default.aspx?fl=20-1479_05032021.mp3.\n\fCase: 20-1479    Document: 62      Page: 8    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 8                                 BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n effective date for \u201cdiscontinuance\u201d). After leaving active\n service, the veteran can once again seek disability benefits,\n but nothing in the statutory scheme speaks to when or how\n those benefits are recommenced.\n      Mr. Buffington\u2019s interpretation would lead to imper-\n missible surplusage, which is not present under the gov-\n ernment\u2019s interpretation. See Nat\u2019l Credit Union Admin.\n v. First Nat\u2019l Bank & Tr. Co., 522 U.S. 479, 500 (1998)\n (holding an interpretation was \u201cimpermissible under the\n first step of Chevron\u201d in part because it created surplus-\n age). Under Mr. Buffington\u2019s interpretation the word pe-\n riod in \u00a7 5304(c) would set both the date for discontinuing\n benefits and the date for recommencing benefits based on\n active service. Congress, however, already enacted a stat-\n ute that sets the date for discontinuing benefits based on\n active service. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5112(b)(3). Adopting\n Mr. Buffington\u2019s construction, then, would render\n \u00a7 5112(b)(3) superfluous.\n      To avoid reading language into \u00a7 5304(c) and rendering\n \u00a7 5112(b)(3) superfluous, we hold the statutory scheme is\n silent regarding the effective date for recommencing bene-\n fits when a disabled veteran leaves active service. 5 Since\n Congress has not \u201cdirectly spoken to the precise question\n at issue,\u201d we must continue on to step two. Chevron, 467\n U.S. at 842.\n                              II\n     At step two, we ask \u201cwhether the agency\u2019s answer [to\n the question at issue] is based on a permissible construc-\n tion of the statute.\u201d Id. at 843. Filling the statutory gap,\n the Secretary promulgated 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2). In\n\n\n     5   Because we hold the statutory scheme is silent, we\n need not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute regarding the pro-vet-\n eran canon. See Terry v. Principi, 340 F.3d 1378, 1383\n (Fed. Cir. 2003).\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62     Page: 9    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON    v. MCDONOUGH                                   9\n\n\n\n relevant part, that regulation defines the effective date for\n any recommencement of benefits after a disabled veteran\n leaves active service:\n       Payments, if otherwise in order, will be resumed\n       effective the day following release from active duty\n       if claim for recommencement of payments is re-\n       ceived within 1 year from the date of such release:\n       otherwise payments will be resumed effective 1\n       year prior to the date of receipt of a new claim.\n Id.\n     As a preliminary matter, Mr. Buffington challenges the\n Secretary\u2019s statutory authority to promulgate 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 3.654(b)(2). But the Secretary was within the scope of his\n authority \u201cto prescribe all rules and regulations which are\n necessary or appropriate to carry out the laws adminis-\n tered by the Department and are consistent with those\n laws.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(a). That authority gives the Secre-\n tary power to fill gaps in the veterans\u2019 benefits scheme. See\n Contreras v. United States, 215 F.3d 1267, 1274 (Fed. Cir.\n 2000) (holding grant of authority to promulgate regulations\n \u201cnecessary to the administration of a program\u201d that an\n agency oversees allows the agency to fill gaps); see also\n Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U.S. 158, 165\n (2007) (holding authorization for Secretary of Labor to\n \u201cprescribe necessary rules, regulations, and orders\u201d pro-\n vided the Department of Labor \u201cwith the power to fill [ex-\n plicit statutory] gaps\u201d). Accordingly, the Secretary had\n power to fill the gap in \u00a7 5304(c) regarding the effective\n date of recommencement with a reasonable regulation.\n     And \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) is a reasonable gap-filling regulation.\n Section 3.654(b)(2) encourages veterans to seek recom-\n mencement of disability benefits in a timely fashion, but it\n always provides a veteran with some compensation. If a\n veteran seeks recommencement within a year of his release\n from active service, he is entitled to benefits effective on\n the day after he left service. If he seeks benefits later, he\n\fCase: 20-1479    Document: 62      Page: 10    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 10                                 BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n is entitled to compensation effective one year before his fil-\n ing date. By incentivizing early filing, \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) pro-\n motes the efficient administration of benefits, but it does\n not promote efficiency at all costs. Mr. Buffington does not\n explain how this incentive structure is unreasonable. As\n we have noted, \u201cthe VA is in a better position than this\n court to evaluate inefficiencies in its system.\u201d Veterans\n Just. Grp., LLC v. Sec\u2019y of Veterans Affs., 818 F.3d 1336,\n 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2016). It is likewise reasonable for the VA\n to require timely reapplication, since a disability may im-\n prove or worsen over time. See 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2)\n (providing that \u201c[c]ompensation will be authorized based\n on the degree of disability found to exist at the time the\n award is resumed\u201d). 6\n                         CONCLUSION\n     Because the VA reasonably filled a statutory gap when\n promulgating 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2), we must defer to that\n regulation. Because the Veterans Court recognized the\n statutory gap and afforded the VA\u2019s regulation appropriate\n deference, we affirm.\n                         AFFIRMED\n                            COSTS\nNo costs.\n\n\n\n\n      6  Mr. Buffington argues that \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) leads to\n an absurd result because, in at least one case where the\n veteran never notified the agency of her active service and\n thus received duplicative benefits, that veteran was only\n forced to return the duplicative benefits. Appellant\u2019s Br.\n 43\u201346. Mr. Buffington\u2019s fairness argument does not bear\n on the reasonableness of \u00a7 3.654(b)(2), but rather on the\n VA\u2019s failure to require regulatory compliance in that case.\n\fCase: 20-1479    Document: 62      Page: 11   Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n    United States Court of Appeals\n        for the Federal Circuit\n                   ______________________\n\n                THOMAS H.

Because of\n that disability, he was awarded disability compensation,\n with an effective date corresponding to the end of his active\n duty service. It is also undisputed that, when he was called\n back to active duty in July 2003\u2014and began receiving ac-\n tive duty pay\u2014his disability payments ceased. And it is\n\fCase: 20-1479    Document: 62       Page: 12   Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 2                                  BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n undisputed that, when Mr. Buffington finished serving his\n country yet again in July 2005, he continued to suffer from\n tinnitus. Despite his continuing disability, however, his\n disability payments were not restored until February 1,\n 2008. The majority endorses the Department of Veterans\n Affairs\u2019 treatment of Mr. Buffington. I do not. I, thus, re-\n spectfully dissent.\n      The majority claims it reaches its conclusion by finding\n a \u201cstatutory gap\u201d in those statutory provisions governing\n payments to veterans at step one of its Chevron analysis.\n It claims it has found this gap without needing to deter-\n mine whether the governing provision\u201438 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 5304(c)\u2014is ambiguous. Turning to step two of Chevron,\n it then finds that the VA acted reasonably when it filled\n that supposed gap with regulations (1) requiring a veteran\n to go through the process of reapplying for disability bene-\n fits and requalifying for the very benefits for which he was\n already deemed qualified; and (2) setting the effective date\n of the resumption of benefits by reference to that reappli-\n cation process, and not by reference to the end of his receipt\n of active duty pay. I disagree on both steps of that analysis.\n                               I.\n                A. There is no \u201cstatutory gap\u201d\n     As noted, at Chevron step one the majority does not\n conclude that 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304 is ambiguous. It, instead,\n finds that, while Congress made clear during what period\n disability payments cannot be paid, it forgot to mention\n when they would restart. This oversight, according to the\n majority, gave the VA the right to legislate via regulation\n the time period and circumstances under which such pay-\n ments would recommence\u2014the right to fill the congression-\n ally created \u201cgap.\u201d\n     The majority puts the cart before the horse in its Chev-\n ron analysis. Rather than apply traditional tools of statu-\n tory construction to determine whether there is an\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62   Page: 13    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON     v. MCDONOUGH                                3\n\n\n\n ambiguity in \u00a7 5304(c), it fast-tracks past this step and\n finds what it believes is a statutory gap that the agency\n may fill. The Supreme Court made clear in Chevron, how-\n ever, that step one always begins by asking whether the\n statute at issue is ambiguous. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat.\n Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842\u201343 (1984) (\u201cFirst,\n always, is the question whether Congress has directly spo-\n ken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Con-\n gress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court,\n as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambigu-\n ously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d). It is only after find-\n ing a statutory ambiguity that courts may consider the\n possibility that Congress delegated to an agency the power\n to fill a gap. See United States v. Home Concrete & Supply,\n LLC, 566 U.S. 478, 488 (2012) (\u201cChevron and later cases\n find in unambiguous language a clear sign that Congress\n did not delegate gap-filling authority to an agency; and\n they find in ambiguous language at least a presumptive in-\n dication that Congress did delegate that gap-filling author-\n ity.\u201d) (emphasis in original). The majority may not avoid\n determining whether \u00a7 5304(c) is ambiguous. Instead, it\n must first focus on whether there is an ambiguity in the\n relevant statute, taking into account any purported statu-\n tory silence in the process.\n     But, a plain reading of the relevant portions of the gov-\n erning statute and careful consideration of the context in\n which they appear demonstrate that there is no statutory\n gap to fill. Section 5304(c)\u2019s text and context militate\n against finding an ambiguity in the statute. To begin, stat-\n utory silence does not always create a statutory gap for the\n purposes of Chevron\u2019s step one analysis. It, instead, often\n indicates the \u201crather unremarkable proposition that some-\n times statutory silence, when viewed in context, is best in-\n terpreted as limiting agency discretion.\u201d Entergy Corp. v.\n Riverkeeper, Inc., 556 U.S. 208, 223 (2009) (citing Whitman\n v.

MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n every silence is pregnant.\u201d) (citation omitted), abrogated on\n other grounds by Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. 817\n (2010). Indeed, \u201c[a]n inference drawn from congressional\n silence certainly cannot be credited when it is contrary to\n all other textual and contextual evidence of congressional\n intent.\u201d Burns, 501 U.S. at 136. Here, congressional intent\n is not difficult to divine.\n      38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1110 and 1131 state that \u201cthe United\n States will pay to any veteran\u201d compensation for service-\n connected disabilities. 1 Section 5110 contains numerous\n provisions regarding precisely when such disability pay-\n ments are to begin, and after which those payments \u201cwill\u201d\n be paid. Section 5110(a) of Title 38 establishes the general\n rule that effective start dates of veterans\u2019 benefits will not\n begin \u201cearlier than the date of receipt\u201d of the veteran\u2019s ap-\n plication for benefits. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(a)(1). Section 5110\n is subject to certain exceptions, all of which are designed to\n increase the benefits to veterans in certain circumstances.\n See, e.g., 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5110(b)(1)\u2013(b)(2) (establishing effec-\n tive date based on variant of one-year look back period for\n disability benefits after veterans are discharged from ac-\n tive duty); id. \u00a7 5110(b)(3) (establishing a one-year look\n back period when veterans submit claims for increase); id.\n \u00a7 5110(b)(4) (establishing a one-year look back period when\n veterans submit claims for disability pension); id. \u00a7 5110(d)\n (establishing a one-year look back period for claims submit-\n ted for death, dependency, and indemnity compensation);\n id. \u00a7 5110(g) (establishing a one-year look back period for\n claims arising from liberalizing law or new administrative\n issue). In other words, Congress knew how to set dates for\n\n\n\n     1    As the majority notes, Mr. Buffington\u2019s disability\n payments were authorized pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131,\n not \u00a7 1110. As the majority also notes, however, there is\n no material difference between the provisions as it relates\n to the issue before us.\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62     Page: 15    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON     v.

Indeed, it calls\n for a pause in all retirement and pension benefits while ac-\n tive duty pay is received. 2 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5112(b)(3) provides\n that all such post-active duty payments shall cease the day\n before any active duty pay begins. While it is true that\n \u00a7 5304(c) does not mention a recommencement date, it is\n clear that Congress only wanted a veteran\u2019s benefits to dis-\n continue for \u201cany period for which such person receives ac-\n tive service pay.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(c) (emphasis added).\n While Congress did not explicitly state in \u00a7 5304(c) that\n disability and retirement benefits will recommence only\n upon active duty ceasing, it did not need to; the contrapos-\n itive of this statutory section says as much. See id. (noting\n that \u201cany period\u201d of active service pay will result in a loss\n of disability benefits). That \u00a7 5304(c) is silent on when ben-\n efits will \u201crecommence\u201d is of no moment. The plain text of\n Title 38 indicates that Congress intended for veterans\u2019 ben-\n efits to discontinue during \u201cany period\u201d of active service\n pay. Outside this \u201cperiod,\u201d the veteran remains entitled to\n the benefits for which he originally qualified.\n      Reading \u00a7 5304(c) as the majority does means the vet-\n eran loses his original effective start date for disability ben-\n efits and must be assigned a later start date, depending on\n when he \u201creapplies\u201d for benefits. See Maj. Op. at 7\u20138\n (\u201c[W]hen a disabled veteran returns to active service, his\n disability benefits are discontinued. . . .

Indeed, because \u00a7 5112(b)(3), like \u00a7\n 5304(c), also applies to all disability compensation, depend-\n ency and indemnity compensation and pension payments,\n the majority\u2019s reading of \u00a7 5304(c) would mean that none of\n those payments would automatically recommence. That\n means that those veterans who return from temporary ac-\n tive duty would not only receive no active duty pay, but,\n absent strict compliance with 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2), would\n receive no disability benefits, no pension, and no other re-\n tirement compensation during at least some post-active\n duty period, despite previously having been deemed quali-\n fied for such payments. That cannot be right. As it relates\n to disability benefits specifically, it is not right because it\n flies in the face of \u00a7 1131\u2019s directive that disability pay-\n ments will be paid once the criteria therefore is satisfied.\n Notably, the government does not contend that active duty\n pay continues until it receives notice that active duty has\n ended or a veteran has reapplied for his other benefits. As\n to these payments, the Secretary apparently has no prob-\n lem giving the \u201cany period\u201d language in \u00a7 5304(c) its plain\n and ordinary meaning.\n      The broader context in which these provisions were en-\n acted confirms the conclusion that disability payments\n should recommence effective the day after active duty pay\n ceases. According to the Supreme Court, Congress\u2019s solici-\n tude towards veterans is \u201cplainly reflected in the [Veterans\n Judicial Review Act (\u201cVJRA\u201d)], as well as subsequent laws\n that place a thumb on the scale in the veteran\u2019s favor in the\n course of administrative and judicial review of VA deci-\n sions.\u201d Henderson ex rel. Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S.\n 428, 440 (2011).

Veterans Appeals Improvement and Moderniza-\n tion Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115\u201355, 131 Stat. 1105 (codi-\n fied in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.). Section 5110(a)(2),\n which was enacted as part of the AMA, amended \u00a7 5110.\n See id. \u00a7 (2)(l)(1), 131 Stat. 1110 (codified as amended at\n \u00a7 5110(a)). Prior to the AMA, effective dates for disability\n benefits were based on the \u201coriginal claim, a claim reo-\n pened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase of\n [benefits].\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(a) (2012). The practical real-\n ity of this scheme meant that veterans who appealed their\n benefits claims by either reopening them or filing for an\n increase in benefits would be subject to the VA\u2019s \u201clegacy\n appeals\u201d process. Legacy appeals were notoriously fraught\n with lengthy wait times that risked greatly delaying a vet-\n eran\u2019s effective start date. See H.R. Rep. No. 115-135, at\n 4\u20135 (2017) (noting the increasing number of undecided VA\n legacy appeals and the long wait times for a final decision);\n see also Legislative Hearing on the Veterans Appeals Im-\n provement and Modernization Act of 2017 Before the H.\n Comm. on Veterans\u2019 Affs., 115th Cong. 15\u201316 (2017).\n     The AMA, however, amended \u00a7 5110(a) in two salient\n ways. First, \u00a7 5110(a)(1) now centered the effective start\n date of benefits around \u201cinitial\u201d or \u201csupplemental\u201d claims.\n By no longer tying effective dates to when veterans reo-\n pened their claims or filed for increases in benefits, Con-\n gress signaled its desire for veterans to receive the earliest\n effective start date possible. Second, Congress added\n \u00a7 5110(a)(2), which states: \u201c[f]or purposes of determining\n the effective date of an award under this section, the date\n of application shall be considered the date of the filing of\n\fCase: 20-1479    Document: 62      Page: 18     Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 8                                 BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n the initial application for a benefit if the claim is continu-\n ously pursued.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(a)(2) (emphasis\n added). Within this same subsection, Congress delineated\n various ways in which veterans could \u201ccontinuously pur-\n sue[]\u201d their claims and receive the earliest effective date\n possible. Id. \u00a7 5110(a)(2)(A)\u2013(E). By effectively providing\n veterans with more options to \u201ccontinuously pursue[]\u201d their\n claims while receiving the earliest effective date possible,\n Congress again signaled its intention to safeguard effective\n start dates.\n     Nowhere in the AMA, VJRA, or Title 38 did Congress\n express an intention for disabled veterans to lose their orig-\n inal effective start dates upon return to active duty. Ra-\n ther, the AMA demonstrates that Congress prioritized\n preserving a veteran\u2019s earliest possible effective start date.\n The majority\u2019s decision is therefore irreconcilable with the\n congressional intent espoused in the AMA because it risks\n veterans receiving later effective start dates than were\n originally assigned. I find it implausible that Congress\n wanted disabled veterans who reenter the service of their\n country to be required to \u201creapply\u201d for the same benefits to\n which they previously were entitled, and also risk having\n their previous effective start dates superseded by a new,\n later date if they do not reapply within the narrow\n timeframe set forth in 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2).\n     The majority\u2019s reading of \u201cany period\u201d in \u00a7 5304(c) also\n defies logic. The majority appears to agree that \u00a7 5304(c)\n prohibits veterans from receiving disability pay during\n \u201cany period\u201d of active service pay. See Maj. Op. at 6 (\u201cThe\n \u2018any period\u2019 phrase in \u00a7 5304(c) . . . refers to a length of\n time: here, the time during which a veteran is receiving ac-\n tive service pay.\u201d). This is correct. Where the majority\n errs, however, is in its assertion that \u201c\u00a7 5304(c) does not\n say compensation must cease only for that period. Con-\n gress was silent regarding whether other conditions, such\n as timely refiling of an application, could justify a later ef-\n fective date.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original).

MCDONOUGH                                 9\n\n\n\n \u00a7 5304(c), Congress chose to use classic conditional logic:\n \u201cany period\u201d during which a veteran receives active service\n pay will result in the veteran not receiving disability bene-\n fits. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(c). Receiving active service pay,\n then, sufficiently guarantees the necessary condition of not\n receiving disability benefits. The majority\u2019s insistence that\n other sufficient conditions, such as \u201ctimely refiling of an\n application,\u201d could also guarantee the loss of disability ben-\n efits improperly imports surplusage into \u00a7 5304(c)\u2019s text.\n \u201c[I]n general, \u2018a matter not covered is to be treated as not\n covered\u2019\u2014a principle \u2018so obvious that it seems absurd to re-\n cite it.\u2019\u201d GE Energy Power Conversion France SAS, Corp.\n v.

Butler, 367 F.2d 528 (8th Cir. 1966)\n (Blackmun, J., dissenting)).\n     To make matters worse, despite initially appearing to\n agree that \u00a7 5304(c) prohibits veterans from receiving dis-\n ability pay during \u201cany period\u201d of active service pay, the\n natural consequence of the majority\u2019s interpretation con-\n travenes the statutory text. In addition to receiving active\n service pay, the majority contends that \u201cother conditions,\n such as timely refiling of an application, could justify a\n later effective date.\u201d Maj. Op. at 6. This means, then, that\n \u201cany period\u201d encompasses more than just the time period\n in which a veteran receives active service pay. Under the\n majority\u2019s reading of \u00a7 5304(c), \u201cany period\u201d must now en-\n compass the period of active service pay plus the period in\n which the veteran has yet to reapply for benefits upon re-\n turning from active duty. As discussed above, \u201ca matter\n not covered is to be treated as not covered.\u201d And, excep-\n tions are to be deemed exclusive unless clear language to\n the contrary says otherwise. The majority errs by ignoring\n both of these principles of statutory construction.\n\fCase: 20-1479    Document: 62      Page: 20     Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 10                                BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n  B. No \u201cconcessions\u201d by Mr. Buffington\u2019s counsel justify the\n             majority\u2019s statutory interpretation\n      The majority contends that the following \u201cconcessions\u201d\n made by Mr. Buffington during oral argument undermine\n his assertion that veterans\u2019 disability benefits should be\n paid continuously, with a pause only under certain circum-\n stances: (1) the VA may require additional medical exams;\n (2) the VA may \u201creconsider\u201d the amount of benefits owed to\n a veteran based on such \u201creexaminations\u201d; and (3) the VA\n can require \u201creapplication\u201d for the \u201crecommencement\u201d of\n benefits following a veteran\u2019s return from active duty. See\n Maj. Op. at 7\u20138. According to the majority, the VA\u2019s ability\n to independently discontinue a veteran\u2019s benefits award\n based on these three circumstances demonstrates that\n \u201c\u00a7 5304(c) does not create a limited exception to a general\n entitlement to benefits.\u201d Id.\n     The majority\u2019s reliance on these supposed \u201cconces-\n sions\u201d is misplaced. First, our duty is to review judgments,\n not counsel\u2019s comments during oral argument. And, where\n that judgment was based on statutory interpretation, noth-\n ing counsel could say could impact what the statute says,\n or does not say. Second, there is nothing meaningful about\n the fact that Mr. Buffington\u2019s counsel has no problem with\n the VA occasionally reassessing the scope of any disability\n award or with requiring a veteran to notify the VA that his\n active duty service has ended, just as the veteran is re-\n quired to notify the VA that his active duty pay recom-\n menced.\n     While there is no statutory provision granting the VA\n the right to conduct additional medical exams or to recon-\n sider benefits awards, that authority arises from the VA\u2019s\n obligation to set the percentage of disability in the first in-\n stance. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.327 states that the VA may require\n reexaminations whenever it \u201cdetermines there is a need to\n verify either the continued existence or the current severity\n of a disability.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.327(a). Though this VA\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62     Page: 21    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON     v. MCDONOUGH                                  11\n\n\n\n regulation does not use the word \u201creconsider,\u201d it intimates\n that the VA may adjust the amount of benefits owed to a\n veteran if the disability has changed since the initial\n award. See id. (\u201cGenerally, reexaminations will be re-\n quired if it is likely that a disability has improved, or if ev-\n idence indicates there has been a material change in a\n disability or that the current rating may be incorrect.\u201d).\n This provision is unrelated to any pause in payment caused\n by active duty service.\n     This regulatory authority does nothing to undermine\n the notion that veterans\u2019 benefits should be continuously\n paid. Rather, \u00a7 3.327(a) simply makes clear that there are\n two levels of inquiry surrounding entitlement to veterans\u2019\n benefits: (1) whether the veteran has a service-connected\n disability that qualifies for benefits; and (2) if so, what the\n level of disability is for ratings purposes. Section 3.327(a)\n involves the latter inquiry as it empowers the VA to reas-\n sess a veteran\u2019s disability for ratings purposes. We are con-\n cerned here, by contrast, with the former inquiry. Once a\n veteran has established a service-connected disability, he\n is entitled to benefits. Though the benefits ratings level\n may change depending on the disability, we are concerned\n here with the continuity of the underlying entitlement.\n Section 3.327(a) is thus irrelevant to our discussion.\n      The majority\u2019s reliance on the VA\u2019s \u201creapplication\u201d re-\n quirement is similarly misplaced. Neither Title 38 nor the\n corresponding VA regulations speak to reapplying for vet-\n erans\u2019 benefits. Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(p), claims exist\n in two forms: (1) an \u201cinitial\u201d claim; or (2) a \u201csupplemental\u201d\n claim. There are three types of initial claims: (1) an origi-\n nal claim, which is the first the VA receives; (2) a new claim\n for different benefits relating to the veteran\u2019s service; and\n (3) a claim for an increase in the benefit amount for either\n type of claim. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 3.1(p)(i)\u2013(ii), 3.160(b). A supple-\n mental claim is filed when a veteran disagrees with a prior\n VA decision. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 3.1(p)(2), 3.2501. As discussed\n above, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(a) ensures that initial and\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62    Page: 22    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 12                                BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n supplemental claims receive the earliest possible effective\n start dates. The concept of a veteran \u201creapplying\u201d for the\n same benefits to which he was previously entitled does not\n fit within any of these definitions. And, to the extent\n 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654 requires reapplication vis-\u00e0-vis its focus\n on \u201crecommencement\u201d of benefits, it is contrary to the plain\n text of \u00a7\u00a7 5304(c) and 1131, as discussed above.\n     What Mr. Buffington\u2019s counsel agreed was reasonable\n is a requirement that the veteran give notice to the VA of\n the date his active duty service ended so that the VA will\n know to recommence benefits as of that date. This is con-\n sistent with how the VA treated Mr. Buffington\u2019s notice of\n his return to active duty. Mr. Buffington notified the VA\n of his return to service in August 2003. In October 2003,\n the VA informed Mr. Buffington that his disability compen-\n sation was discontinued effective July 20, 2003\u2014the day\n before his return to active duty. In other words, the VA did\n not allow his disability pay to continue until it received no-\n tice of his change in status; once it received notice, it had\n no problem backdating the cessation of benefits. Mr. Buff-\n ington argues that the VA similarly should have no prob-\n lem backdating the recommencement of benefits, once it is\n notified of the date on which a veteran\u2019s active duty ceased.\n      The majority\u2019s focus on Mr. Buffington\u2019s concessions re-\n garding reexamination, reconsideration, and reapplication\n is simply unpersuasive. To the extent the VA implements\n these concepts, they do nothing to rebut the notion that vet-\n erans\u2019 benefits should be continuously administered but for\n any period when active duty pay is received.\n                C. There is no surplusage concern\n     The majority finally contends that reading the \u201cany pe-\n riod\u201d language of \u00a7 5304(c) to \u201cset both the date for discon-\n tinuing benefits and the date for recommencing benefits\n based on active service\u201d renders \u00a7 5112(b)(3) superfluous.\n Maj. Op. at 8. According to the majority, Congress chose to\n define the effective date of the discontinuation of benefits\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62   Page: 23    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON     v. MCDONOUGH                               13\n\n\n\n in \u00a7 5112(b) but not to specify the effective date of recom-\n mencement of disability benefits following a veteran\u2019s pe-\n riod of active service. It claims that construing \u00a7 5304(c)\u2019s\n \u201cany period\u201d language as setting the discontinuance and\n recommencement dates of awards requires reading into the\n statute a \u201cday-before\u201d discontinuance date and a \u201cday-af-\n ter\u201d recommencement date. Since Congress already pro-\n vided a \u201cday-before\u201d discontinuance date in \u00a7 5112(b)(3),\n the majority argues that interpreting \u201cany period\u201d in\n \u00a7 5304(c) to include a \u201cday-before\u201d and a \u201cday-after\u201d effec-\n tive dates would create impermissible surplusage in\n \u00a7 5112(b)(3).\n      The majority\u2019s argument rests on a misinterpretation\n of the statutory text. Section 5304(c)\u2019s \u201cany period\u201d lan-\n guage does not create new effective dates. As discussed\n above, \u00a7\u00a7 5110 and 5112(b)(3) do this by establishing start\n and discontinuance effective dates, respectively. When\n read alongside \u00a7 5112(b)(3), \u00a7 5304(c) merely delineates the\n period of pause in benefits, with \u00a7 5112(b)\u2019s discontinuance\n effective date giving effect to \u00a7 5304(c)\u2019s bar on duplicate\n benefits. It is notable, moreover, that \u00a7 5112(b)(3) actually\n does extra work than the phrase \u201cany period\u201d in \u00a7 5304(c):\n it sets a discontinuance date the day before the period in\n \u00a7 5304(c) commences.       If anything, the existence of\n \u00a7 5112(b)(3) proves that when Congress wanted to set a\n commencement or recommencement date that differed\n from the start and end of the \u201cperiod\u201d referenced in\n \u00a7 5304(c), it knew how to do so expressly.\n   D. Doubt regarding any recommencement date must be\n             resolved in Mr. Buffington\u2019s favor\n     The majority asserts that, because it finds a \u201cstatutory\n gap\u201d regarding the recommencement of benefits, it may ig-\n nore the pro-veteran canon of construction in its Chevron\n step one analysis. But that logic does not withstand dis-\n section. What the majority appears to really say is that, by\n not expressly setting a date for recommencement of\n\fCase: 20-1479     Document: 62      Page: 24    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 14                                 BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n benefits as clearly as it did for a discontinuation of benefits,\n Congress gave the VA the greenlight to finish the statute\n via regulation. Calling what it finds a \u201cstatutory gap\u201d does\n not alter the reality of what the majority concludes, how-\n ever, or what the implications of that conclusion are.\n     As described above, the majority failed to correctly ap-\n ply Chevron\u2019s step one analysis because it found a statutory\n gap in \u00a7 5304(c) without first finding an ambiguity. As part\n of a correct Chevron step one analysis, the majority must\n take into account all other traditional canons of construc-\n tion along the way, including the pro-veteran canon of con-\n struction. Cf. Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2414 (2019)\n (\u201cKisor II\u201d) (\u201c[T]he possibility of deference can arise only if\n a regulation is genuinely ambiguous. And when we use\n that term, we mean it\u2014genuinely ambiguous, even after a\n court has resorted to all the standard tools of interpreta-\n tion.\u201d).\n     The majority cites Terry v. Principi, 340 F.3d 1378,\n 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2003) as support for its decision to jettison\n any discussion of Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115 (1994)\n and the presumption in favor of veteran-friendly statutory\n interpretations Gardner creates. But Terry is materially\n distinguishable. Terry expressly found that the statute at\n issue was unambiguous; that it was not open to any inter-\n pretive doubt once its terms were given their common and\n ordinary meaning. See Terry, 340 F.3d at 1383. It found\n that Congress gave the VA the right to regulate so as to\n give effect to that unambiguous statutory scheme.\n     That is very different from what the majority does here.\n It does not say that Congress unambiguously required that\n disability benefits end, rather than pause, and unambigu-\n ously authorized the VA to require veterans to go through\n the onerous disability application process anew merely be-\n cause they answered the call to return to active duty. It\n simply finds a silence that needs filling. But, to the extent\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62    Page: 25    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON     v. MCDONOUGH                                15\n\n\n\n there is any silence, it is our job to interpret what that si-\n lence means in the first instance, not the VA\u2019s.\n      On the way to resolving that question, to the extent any\n interpretive doubt remains, we must apply the Gardner\n presumption and resolve any ambiguity about what Con-\n gress meant in Mr. Buffington\u2019s favor. See Kisor II, 139\n S. Ct. at 2414; see also Henderson, 562 U.S. at 441 (\u201cWe\n have long applied \u2018the canon that provisions for benefits to\n members of the Armed Services are to be construed in the\n beneficiaries\u2019 favor.\u2019\u201d) (citing King v. St. Vincent\u2019s Hosp.,\n 502 U.S. 215, 220\u201321, n.9 (1991)). Even if its use is to be\n limited to circumstances in which interpretive doubt re-\n mains after considering various other tools of construction\n during the step one Chevron analysis, see Kisor v.\n McDonough, 995 F.3d 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (\u201cKisor IV\u201d), it\n remains an interpretive tool in the court\u2019s statutory con-\n struction toolbox that is to be employed before resorting to\n Chevron deference, see Kisor II, 139 S. Ct. at 2415\n (\u201c[B]efore concluding that a rule is genuinely ambiguous, a\n court must exhaust all the \u2018traditional tools\u2019 of construc-\n tion.\u201d); see also Arangure v. Whitaker, 911 F.3d 333, 346\n (6th Cir. 2018) (noting that the Supreme Court applies a\n \u201ccanons first\u201d before deference approach to Chevron, even\n considering policy-based or normative canons at Chevron\n step one); see also Kenneth A. Bamberger, Normative Can-\n ons in the Review of Administrative Policymaking, 118 Yale\n L.J. 64, 77 (2008) (\u201c[C]anons trump deference.\u201d). 3 The ma-\n jority cannot avoid addressing the Gardner presumption by\n avoiding determining whether \u00a7 5304(c) is ambiguous. To\n do so is to ignore our job under Chevron. As noted above,\n\n\n\n\n     3   To the extent this court has previously placed con-\n sideration of the Gardner presumption after considerations\n of deference, Kisor II made clear that the inquiry is to be\n done in the reverse order.\n\fCase: 20-1479    Document: 62        Page: 26   Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 16                                  BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n there is nothing ambiguous about the \u201cany period\u201d lan-\n guage in \u00a7 5304(c).\n                               II.\n      After finding a gap in \u00a7 5304(c)\u2019s statutory text, the ma-\n jority moves on to Chevron step two. The majority con-\n cludes that 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) is a reasonable gap-\n filling measure because it \u201cincentivizes early filing\u201d of re-\n commencement of benefits, thereby promoting efficiency\n within the VA. Maj. Op. at 10. But requiring veterans to\n reapply for benefits to which they previously were entitled\n seems anything but efficient. If efficiency is paramount,\n then interpreting \u00a7 5304(c) as enacting a pause in benefits\n for \u201cany period\u201d during which a veteran returns to active\n duty better achieves that goal.\n     The majority also reasons that 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2)\u2019s\n requirement of \u201ctimely reapplication\u201d for benefits is reason-\n able because a veteran\u2019s \u201cdisability may improve or worsen\n over time.\u201d Id. Impliedly, the \u201creasonable\u201d functions\n served by \u201creapplication\u201d for benefits involve modifying the\n amount of benefits according to the severity of the veteran\u2019s\n disability.\n     As noted above, several other regulatory and statutory\n mechanisms, however, serve these functions. The VA uses\n reexaminations to monitor the changing levels of a vet-\n eran\u2019s disability and to adjust the award amount based on\n the disability rating. See 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.327(a). And, in the\n event of a veteran\u2019s disability worsening, 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 5110(b)(3) allows veterans to file claims for increased\n awards. The means of addressing different disability rat-\n ings are thus already baked into the statutory and regula-\n tory framework. They should not muddy our analysis,\n which focuses on whether 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2)\u2019s complex\n benefits scheme comports with the statutory text of Title\n 38\u2019s effective start and discontinuance dates\u2014as well as\n any pauses pursuant to \u00a7 5304(c)\u2019s \u201cany period\u201d language.\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62    Page: 27    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON     v. MCDONOUGH                                17\n\n\n\n     Quite simply, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) serves no purpose\n other than to deny disability benefits (and other critical re-\n tirement benefits) to veterans entitled to them solely be-\n cause these men and women answered the call to return to\n active duty. That is wholly inconsistent with the benefi-\n cent scheme in which the relevant statutory provisions ap-\n pear and with the congressional intent behind both the\n VJRA and the AMA. I dissent from the majority\u2019s endorse-\n ment of this offensive regulation.\n\f",

Under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2), the Veterans Court de-\n nied Mr. Buffington an earlier effective date for recom-\n mencement of his disability benefits after periods in which\n he received active service pay.

Because we hold\n \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) reasonably fills a statutory gap, we affirm.\n                       BACKGROUND\n     Mr. Buffington served on active duty in the United\n States Air Force from September 1992 until May 2000. Af-\n ter leaving active duty service, Mr. Buffington sought dis-\n ability benefits. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\n found that Mr. Buffington suffered from service-connected\n tinnitus, rated his disability at ten percent, and awarded\n\n\n     *    Chief Judge Kimberly A. Moore assumed the posi-\n tion of Chief Judge on May 22, 2021.\n\fCase: 20-1479     Document: 62      Page: 3     Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH                                     3\n\n\n\n him disability compensation. In 2003, Mr. Buffington was\n recalled to active duty in the Air National Guard. He in-\n formed the VA of his return to active service, and the VA\n discontinued his disability compensation. See 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7\u00a7 5112(b)(3), 5304(c). In 2004, Mr. Buffington completed\n his term of active service. Later that year, he was again\n recalled to active duty, serving until July 2005. It was not\n until January 2009, however, that Mr. Buffington sought\n to recommence his disability benefits. The VA determined\n Mr. Buffington was entitled to compensation effective on\n February 1, 2008\u2014one year before he sought recommence-\n ment. See 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) (setting effective date for\n recommencement of compensation, at the earliest, one year\n before filing).\n     Mr. Buffington filed a Notice of Disagreement, chal-\n lenging the VA\u2019s effective-date determination. The VA Re-\n gional Office issued a Statement of the Case rejecting his\n challenge and providing further reasoning for the February\n 1, 2008 effective date. Mr. Buffington then appealed to the\n Board of Veterans Appeals, which affirmed the VA\u2019s deci-\n sion. He next appealed to the Veterans Court. That court\n held that \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) was a valid exercise of the Secretary\n of Veterans Affairs rulemaking authority and was not in-\n consistent with 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(c). See Veterans Court\n Op., 31 Vet. App. at 300\u201304. Mr. Buffington appeals. We\n have jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a).\n                          DISCUSSION\n      Title 38 codifies a complex statutory scheme aimed at\n providing benefits to veterans. For example, it provides\n veterans with a general entitlement to compensation \u201c[f]or\n disabilit[ies] resulting from personal injur[ies] suffered . . .\n in [the] line of duty\u201d during a period of war, \u00a7 1110, or dur-\n ing peacetime, \u00a7 1131. As a shorthand, Congress refers to\n those disabilities as service-connected disabilities. See 38\n U.S.C. ch. 11 (\u201cCompensation for Service-Connected Disa-\n bility or Death\u201d). And it refers to benefits paid as a result\n\fCase: 20-1479     Document: 62     Page: 4    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 4                                 BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n of service-connected disabilities as compensation. Id.\n \u00a7 101(13). Title 38 also provides pensions for veterans who\n served in a period of war and for veterans who appear on\n the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Coast Guard Medal of Honor\n Roll. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 1511\u201325.\n      To receive disability benefits, a veteran must apply. Id.\n \u00a7 5101(a)(1)(A) (\u201c[A] specific claim in the form prescribed\n by the Secretary . . . must be filed in order for benefits to\n be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws ad-\n ministered by the Secretary.\u201d). Based on that application,\n the VA must determine whether the veteran has a general\n entitlement to disability benefits\u2014for example, because he\n has a service-connected disability. If a veteran has a ser-\n vice-connected disability, the VA must assign him a disa-\n bility rating, which corresponds to the amount of\n compensation paid. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 1134 (setting rates of\n peacetime disability compensation by reference to \u00a7 1114,\n which sets those rates for wartime disability). It must also\n set the effective date for the award of benefits. Id. \u00a7 5110.\n Occasionally, under the statutory framework, benefits\n must be reduced or discontinued. When a veteran returns\n to active service, for example, he cannot receive both active\n service pay and disability compensation. Id. \u00a7 5304(c).\n When a reduction or discontinuance is in order, \u00a7 5112 dic-\n tates how the VA must determine the effective date for that\n reduction or discontinuance.\n     This appeal requires us to interpret VA-administered\n statutes to determine the effective date for recommencing\n (as opposed to awarding or discontinuing) service-con-\n nected disability benefits once a veteran leaves active ser-\n vice. 1 The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has answered that\n\n\n     1   Mr. Buffington argues the question at issue should\n be framed as whether the VA can effect a forfeiture of ben-\n efits. But that framing assumes the interpretive conclu-\n sion.\n\fCase: 20-1479     Document: 62      Page: 5     Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON   v.

Section 5304(c) bars duplicative com-\n pensation when a veteran receives active service pay:\n     Pension, compensation, or retirement pay on ac-\n     count of any person\u2019s own service shall not be paid\n     to such person for any period for which such person\n     receives active service pay.\n\n\n\n     2      Amicus New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) ar-\n gues the Chevron framework should not apply. Neither\n party adopts this position, see Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7 (\u201cThis\n question is governed by the two-step framework of Chevron\n . . . .\u201d) and Appellee\u2019s Brief at 12, and we do not find it per-\n suasive given the facts and arguments presented here.\n\fCase: 20-1479     Document: 62     Page: 6    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 6                                 BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(c). Thus, a veteran cannot receive both\n service-connected disability payments and active service\n pay. And Congress set the effective date (start date) for\n discontinuing disability benefits based on active service:\n     The effective date of a reduction or discontinuance\n     of compensation . . . by reason of receipt of active\n     service pay or retirement pay shall be the day be-\n     fore the date such pay began.\n 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5112(b)(3). But Congress did not establish\n when or under what conditions compensation recom-\n mences once a disabled veteran leaves active service. No-\n where in \u00a7 5304(c)\u2019s plain terms or in the broader statutory\n structure did Congress speak directly to that issue.\n      The \u201cany period\u201d phrase in \u00a7 5304(c) does not set the\n effective date for recommencing disability benefits. Of\n course, the word period refers to a length of time: here, the\n time during which a veteran is receiving active service pay.\n And that period has a beginning date\u2014when active service\n compensation starts\u2014and an end date\u2014when active ser-\n vice compensation ends. But \u00a7 5304(c) does not say com-\n pensation must cease only for that period. Congress was\n silent regarding whether other conditions, such as timely\n filing of an application, could justify a later effective date\n for any recommencement of compensation. Congress nei-\n ther required nor prohibited consideration of such condi-\n tions. And we must not read into \u00a7 5304(c) words that\n Congress did not enact\u2014like reading \u201cany period\u201d as \u201conly\n any period.\u201d See Bates v.

He claims Title 38 obligates the\n VA to pay compensation for service-connected disabilities,\n\fCase: 20-1479     Document: 62      Page: 7    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH                                    7\n\n\n\n see 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131; 3 sets the effective date for those\n awards, see id. \u00a7 5110; and provides a limited exception for\n when payment is barred based on active service pay, see id.\n \u00a7 5304(c). Thus, to Mr. Buffington, \u201ccompensation runs\n parallel to the period of service: stopping on re-entry to ac-\n tive military service and restarting at discharge from ac-\n tive military service.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 14\u201315\n (internal quotation marks omitted).\n     Mr. Buffington\u2019s concessions throughout this case,\n however, undermine that position. In his opening brief,\n Mr. Buffington agreed the VA can \u201crequire that a veteran\n notify it that the veteran is no longer receiving active duty\n pay before benefits can be paid.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 32 (em-\n phasis in original). That is, the VA can require a veteran\n to apply for recommencement of disability benefits. See 38\n C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) (creating just such a requirement).\n And at argument, Mr. Buffington went further. Ques-\n tioned about Mr. Buffington\u2019s admissions in his briefing,\n Mr. Buffington\u2019s counsel conceded that \u201cthe government\n can certainly require reapplication[,] . . . can require a vet-\n eran to appear for an additional medical exam[, and] . . .\n can reconsider the amount of disability compensation.\u201d See\n Oral Arg. 4 at 4:50\u20135:45. Implicit in that view is the under-\n standing that \u00a7 5304(c) does not create a limited exception\n to a general entitlement to benefits. Instead, when a disa-\n bled veteran returns to active service, his disability bene-\n fits are discontinued.

Despite his continuing disability, however, his\n disability payments were not restored until February 1,\n 2008. The majority endorses the Department of Veterans\n Affairs\u2019 treatment of Mr. Buffington. I do not. I, thus, re-\n spectfully dissent.\n      The majority claims it reaches its conclusion by finding\n a \u201cstatutory gap\u201d in those statutory provisions governing\n payments to veterans at step one of its Chevron analysis.\n It claims it has found this gap without needing to deter-\n mine whether the governing provision\u201438 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 5304(c)\u2014is ambiguous. Turning to step two of Chevron,\n it then finds that the VA acted reasonably when it filled\n that supposed gap with regulations (1) requiring a veteran\n to go through the process of reapplying for disability bene-\n fits and requalifying for the very benefits for which he was\n already deemed qualified; and (2) setting the effective date\n of the resumption of benefits by reference to that reappli-\n cation process, and not by reference to the end of his receipt\n of active duty pay. I disagree on both steps of that analysis.\n                               I.\n                A. There is no \u201cstatutory gap\u201d\n     As noted, at Chevron step one the majority does not\n conclude that 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304 is ambiguous. It, instead,\n finds that, while Congress made clear during what period\n disability payments cannot be paid, it forgot to mention\n when they would restart. This oversight, according to the\n majority, gave the VA the right to legislate via regulation\n the time period and circumstances under which such pay-\n ments would recommence\u2014the right to fill the congression-\n ally created \u201cgap.\u201d\n     The majority puts the cart before the horse in its Chev-\n ron analysis.

Here, congressional intent\n is not difficult to divine.\n      38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1110 and 1131 state that \u201cthe United\n States will pay to any veteran\u201d compensation for service-\n connected disabilities. 1 Section 5110 contains numerous\n provisions regarding precisely when such disability pay-\n ments are to begin, and after which those payments \u201cwill\u201d\n be paid. Section 5110(a) of Title 38 establishes the general\n rule that effective start dates of veterans\u2019 benefits will not\n begin \u201cearlier than the date of receipt\u201d of the veteran\u2019s ap-\n plication for benefits. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(a)(1). Section 5110\n is subject to certain exceptions, all of which are designed to\n increase the benefits to veterans in certain circumstances.\n See, e.g., 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5110(b)(1)\u2013(b)(2) (establishing effec-\n tive date based on variant of one-year look back period for\n disability benefits after veterans are discharged from ac-\n tive duty); id. \u00a7 5110(b)(3) (establishing a one-year look\n back period when veterans submit claims for increase); id.\n \u00a7 5110(b)(4) (establishing a one-year look back period when\n veterans submit claims for disability pension); id. \u00a7 5110(d)\n (establishing a one-year look back period for claims submit-\n ted for death, dependency, and indemnity compensation);\n id. \u00a7 5110(g) (establishing a one-year look back period for\n claims arising from liberalizing law or new administrative\n issue). In other words, Congress knew how to set dates for\n\n\n\n     1    As the majority notes, Mr. Buffington\u2019s disability\n payments were authorized pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1131,\n not \u00a7 1110. As the majority also notes, however, there is\n no material difference between the provisions as it relates\n to the issue before us.\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62     Page: 15    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON     v. MCDONOUGH                                   5\n\n\n\n commencement of benefits when it deemed it necessary to\n do so, and, when doing so, it always assured that benefits\n would commence sooner rather than later.\n      38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(c) is an exception to the continuous\n payment obligation, calling for a pause in such payments\n while a veteran is receiving active duty pay. Indeed, it calls\n for a pause in all retirement and pension benefits while ac-\n tive duty pay is received. 2 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5112(b)(3) provides\n that all such post-active duty payments shall cease the day\n before any active duty pay begins. While it is true that\n \u00a7 5304(c) does not mention a recommencement date, it is\n clear that Congress only wanted a veteran\u2019s benefits to dis-\n continue for \u201cany period for which such person receives ac-\n tive service pay.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(c) (emphasis added).\n While Congress did not explicitly state in \u00a7 5304(c) that\n disability and retirement benefits will recommence only\n upon active duty ceasing, it did not need to; the contrapos-\n itive of this statutory section says as much. See id. (noting\n that \u201cany period\u201d of active service pay will result in a loss\n of disability benefits). That \u00a7 5304(c) is silent on when ben-\n efits will \u201crecommence\u201d is of no moment. The plain text of\n Title 38 indicates that Congress intended for veterans\u2019 ben-\n efits to discontinue during \u201cany period\u201d of active service\n pay. Outside this \u201cperiod,\u201d the veteran remains entitled to\n the benefits for which he originally qualified.\n      Reading \u00a7 5304(c) as the majority does means the vet-\n eran loses his original effective start date for disability ben-\n efits and must be assigned a later start date, depending on\n when he \u201creapplies\u201d for benefits. See Maj. Op. at 7\u20138\n (\u201c[W]hen a disabled veteran returns to active service, his\n disability benefits are discontinued. . . . After leaving\n\n\n     2   Technically, veterans have a choice to continue dis-\n ability and other retirement payments during active duty\n or receive active duty pay. The point is that they cannot\n receive both.\n\fCase: 20-1479    Document: 62      Page: 16     Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 6                                 BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n active service, the veteran can once again seek disability\n benefits . . . .\u201d). Indeed, because \u00a7 5112(b)(3), like \u00a7\n 5304(c), also applies to all disability compensation, depend-\n ency and indemnity compensation and pension payments,\n the majority\u2019s reading of \u00a7 5304(c) would mean that none of\n those payments would automatically recommence. That\n means that those veterans who return from temporary ac-\n tive duty would not only receive no active duty pay, but,\n absent strict compliance with 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2), would\n receive no disability benefits, no pension, and no other re-\n tirement compensation during at least some post-active\n duty period, despite previously having been deemed quali-\n fied for such payments. That cannot be right. As it relates\n to disability benefits specifically, it is not right because it\n flies in the face of \u00a7 1131\u2019s directive that disability pay-\n ments will be paid once the criteria therefore is satisfied.\n Notably, the government does not contend that active duty\n pay continues until it receives notice that active duty has\n ended or a veteran has reapplied for his other benefits. As\n to these payments, the Secretary apparently has no prob-\n lem giving the \u201cany period\u201d language in \u00a7 5304(c) its plain\n and ordinary meaning.\n      The broader context in which these provisions were en-\n acted confirms the conclusion that disability payments\n should recommence effective the day after active duty pay\n ceases. According to the Supreme Court, Congress\u2019s solici-\n tude towards veterans is \u201cplainly reflected in the [Veterans\n Judicial Review Act (\u201cVJRA\u201d)], as well as subsequent laws\n that place a thumb on the scale in the veteran\u2019s favor in the\n course of administrative and judicial review of VA deci-\n sions.\u201d Henderson ex rel.

No. 100\u2013963, at 13 (1988), reprinted in 1988\n U.S.C.C.A.N. 5782, 5794\u201395. Indeed, the VJRA is replete\n with provisions designed to make it easier for veterans to\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62    Page: 17    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON     v. MCDONOUGH                                 7\n\n\n\n obtain benefits and to challenge denial of such benefits.\n The development of this veteran-friendly scheme and its\n remedial nature was the very raison d\u2019\u00eatre for passage of\n the VJRA.\n      In addition to the VJRA, one such \u201csubsequent law[]\u201d\n Congress passed to favor veterans comprises the Veterans\n Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017\n (\u201cAMA\u201d). Veterans Appeals Improvement and Moderniza-\n tion Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115\u201355, 131 Stat. 1105 (codi-\n fied in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.). Section 5110(a)(2),\n which was enacted as part of the AMA, amended \u00a7 5110.\n See id. \u00a7 (2)(l)(1), 131 Stat. 1110 (codified as amended at\n \u00a7 5110(a)). Prior to the AMA, effective dates for disability\n benefits were based on the \u201coriginal claim, a claim reo-\n pened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase of\n [benefits].\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(a) (2012). The practical real-\n ity of this scheme meant that veterans who appealed their\n benefits claims by either reopening them or filing for an\n increase in benefits would be subject to the VA\u2019s \u201clegacy\n appeals\u201d process. Legacy appeals were notoriously fraught\n with lengthy wait times that risked greatly delaying a vet-\n eran\u2019s effective start date. See H.R. Rep. No. 115-135, at\n 4\u20135 (2017) (noting the increasing number of undecided VA\n legacy appeals and the long wait times for a final decision);\n see also Legislative Hearing on the Veterans Appeals Im-\n provement and Modernization Act of 2017 Before the H.\n Comm. on Veterans\u2019 Affs., 115th Cong. 15\u201316 (2017).\n     The AMA, however, amended \u00a7 5110(a) in two salient\n ways. First, \u00a7 5110(a)(1) now centered the effective start\n date of benefits around \u201cinitial\u201d or \u201csupplemental\u201d claims.\n By no longer tying effective dates to when veterans reo-\n pened their claims or filed for increases in benefits, Con-\n gress signaled its desire for veterans to receive the earliest\n effective start date possible. Second, Congress added\n \u00a7 5110(a)(2), which states: \u201c[f]or purposes of determining\n the effective date of an award under this section, the date\n of application shall be considered the date of the filing of\n\fCase: 20-1479    Document: 62      Page: 18     Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 8                                 BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n the initial application for a benefit if the claim is continu-\n ously pursued.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(a)(2) (emphasis\n added). Within this same subsection, Congress delineated\n various ways in which veterans could \u201ccontinuously pur-\n sue[]\u201d their claims and receive the earliest effective date\n possible. Id. \u00a7 5110(a)(2)(A)\u2013(E). By effectively providing\n veterans with more options to \u201ccontinuously pursue[]\u201d their\n claims while receiving the earliest effective date possible,\n Congress again signaled its intention to safeguard effective\n start dates.\n     Nowhere in the AMA, VJRA, or Title 38 did Congress\n express an intention for disabled veterans to lose their orig-\n inal effective start dates upon return to active duty. Ra-\n ther, the AMA demonstrates that Congress prioritized\n preserving a veteran\u2019s earliest possible effective start date.\n The majority\u2019s decision is therefore irreconcilable with the\n congressional intent espoused in the AMA because it risks\n veterans receiving later effective start dates than were\n originally assigned. I find it implausible that Congress\n wanted disabled veterans who reenter the service of their\n country to be required to \u201creapply\u201d for the same benefits to\n which they previously were entitled, and also risk having\n their previous effective start dates superseded by a new,\n later date if they do not reapply within the narrow\n timeframe set forth in 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2).\n     The majority\u2019s reading of \u201cany period\u201d in \u00a7 5304(c) also\n defies logic. The majority appears to agree that \u00a7 5304(c)\n prohibits veterans from receiving disability pay during\n \u201cany period\u201d of active service pay. See Maj. Op. at 6 (\u201cThe\n \u2018any period\u2019 phrase in \u00a7 5304(c) . . . refers to a length of\n time: here, the time during which a veteran is receiving ac-\n tive service pay.\u201d). This is correct. Where the majority\n errs, however, is in its assertion that \u201c\u00a7 5304(c) does not\n say compensation must cease only for that period. Con-\n gress was silent regarding whether other conditions, such\n as timely refiling of an application, could justify a later ef-\n fective date.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original). In legislating\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62    Page: 19    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON     v. MCDONOUGH                                 9\n\n\n\n \u00a7 5304(c), Congress chose to use classic conditional logic:\n \u201cany period\u201d during which a veteran receives active service\n pay will result in the veteran not receiving disability bene-\n fits. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5304(c). Receiving active service pay,\n then, sufficiently guarantees the necessary condition of not\n receiving disability benefits. The majority\u2019s insistence that\n other sufficient conditions, such as \u201ctimely refiling of an\n application,\u201d could also guarantee the loss of disability ben-\n efits improperly imports surplusage into \u00a7 5304(c)\u2019s text.\n \u201c[I]n general, \u2018a matter not covered is to be treated as not\n covered\u2019\u2014a principle \u2018so obvious that it seems absurd to re-\n cite it.\u2019\u201d GE Energy Power Conversion France SAS, Corp.\n v.

In addition to receiving active\n service pay, the majority contends that \u201cother conditions,\n such as timely refiling of an application, could justify a\n later effective date.\u201d Maj. Op. at 6. This means, then, that\n \u201cany period\u201d encompasses more than just the time period\n in which a veteran receives active service pay. Under the\n majority\u2019s reading of \u00a7 5304(c), \u201cany period\u201d must now en-\n compass the period of active service pay plus the period in\n which the veteran has yet to reapply for benefits upon re-\n turning from active duty. As discussed above, \u201ca matter\n not covered is to be treated as not covered.\u201d And, excep-\n tions are to be deemed exclusive unless clear language to\n the contrary says otherwise. The majority errs by ignoring\n both of these principles of statutory construction.\n\fCase: 20-1479    Document: 62      Page: 20     Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 10                                BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n  B. No \u201cconcessions\u201d by Mr. Buffington\u2019s counsel justify the\n             majority\u2019s statutory interpretation\n      The majority contends that the following \u201cconcessions\u201d\n made by Mr. Buffington during oral argument undermine\n his assertion that veterans\u2019 disability benefits should be\n paid continuously, with a pause only under certain circum-\n stances: (1) the VA may require additional medical exams;\n (2) the VA may \u201creconsider\u201d the amount of benefits owed to\n a veteran based on such \u201creexaminations\u201d; and (3) the VA\n can require \u201creapplication\u201d for the \u201crecommencement\u201d of\n benefits following a veteran\u2019s return from active duty. See\n Maj. Op. at 7\u20138. According to the majority, the VA\u2019s ability\n to independently discontinue a veteran\u2019s benefits award\n based on these three circumstances demonstrates that\n \u201c\u00a7 5304(c) does not create a limited exception to a general\n entitlement to benefits.\u201d Id.\n     The majority\u2019s reliance on these supposed \u201cconces-\n sions\u201d is misplaced. First, our duty is to review judgments,\n not counsel\u2019s comments during oral argument. And, where\n that judgment was based on statutory interpretation, noth-\n ing counsel could say could impact what the statute says,\n or does not say. Second, there is nothing meaningful about\n the fact that Mr. Buffington\u2019s counsel has no problem with\n the VA occasionally reassessing the scope of any disability\n award or with requiring a veteran to notify the VA that his\n active duty service has ended, just as the veteran is re-\n quired to notify the VA that his active duty pay recom-\n menced.\n     While there is no statutory provision granting the VA\n the right to conduct additional medical exams or to recon-\n sider benefits awards, that authority arises from the VA\u2019s\n obligation to set the percentage of disability in the first in-\n stance. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.327 states that the VA may require\n reexaminations whenever it \u201cdetermines there is a need to\n verify either the continued existence or the current severity\n of a disability.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.327(a). Though this VA\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62     Page: 21    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON     v. MCDONOUGH                                  11\n\n\n\n regulation does not use the word \u201creconsider,\u201d it intimates\n that the VA may adjust the amount of benefits owed to a\n veteran if the disability has changed since the initial\n award. See id. (\u201cGenerally, reexaminations will be re-\n quired if it is likely that a disability has improved, or if ev-\n idence indicates there has been a material change in a\n disability or that the current rating may be incorrect.\u201d).\n This provision is unrelated to any pause in payment caused\n by active duty service.\n     This regulatory authority does nothing to undermine\n the notion that veterans\u2019 benefits should be continuously\n paid. Rather, \u00a7 3.327(a) simply makes clear that there are\n two levels of inquiry surrounding entitlement to veterans\u2019\n benefits: (1) whether the veteran has a service-connected\n disability that qualifies for benefits; and (2) if so, what the\n level of disability is for ratings purposes. Section 3.327(a)\n involves the latter inquiry as it empowers the VA to reas-\n sess a veteran\u2019s disability for ratings purposes. We are con-\n cerned here, by contrast, with the former inquiry. Once a\n veteran has established a service-connected disability, he\n is entitled to benefits. Though the benefits ratings level\n may change depending on the disability, we are concerned\n here with the continuity of the underlying entitlement.\n Section 3.327(a) is thus irrelevant to our discussion.\n      The majority\u2019s reliance on the VA\u2019s \u201creapplication\u201d re-\n quirement is similarly misplaced. Neither Title 38 nor the\n corresponding VA regulations speak to reapplying for vet-\n erans\u2019 benefits. Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(p), claims exist\n in two forms: (1) an \u201cinitial\u201d claim; or (2) a \u201csupplemental\u201d\n claim. There are three types of initial claims: (1) an origi-\n nal claim, which is the first the VA receives; (2) a new claim\n for different benefits relating to the veteran\u2019s service; and\n (3) a claim for an increase in the benefit amount for either\n type of claim. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 3.1(p)(i)\u2013(ii), 3.160(b). A supple-\n mental claim is filed when a veteran disagrees with a prior\n VA decision. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 3.1(p)(2), 3.2501. As discussed\n above, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5110(a) ensures that initial and\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62    Page: 22    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 12                                BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n supplemental claims receive the earliest possible effective\n start dates. The concept of a veteran \u201creapplying\u201d for the\n same benefits to which he was previously entitled does not\n fit within any of these definitions. And, to the extent\n 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654 requires reapplication vis-\u00e0-vis its focus\n on \u201crecommencement\u201d of benefits, it is contrary to the plain\n text of \u00a7\u00a7 5304(c) and 1131, as discussed above.\n     What Mr. Buffington\u2019s counsel agreed was reasonable\n is a requirement that the veteran give notice to the VA of\n the date his active duty service ended so that the VA will\n know to recommence benefits as of that date. This is con-\n sistent with how the VA treated Mr. Buffington\u2019s notice of\n his return to active duty. Mr. Buffington notified the VA\n of his return to service in August 2003. In October 2003,\n the VA informed Mr. Buffington that his disability compen-\n sation was discontinued effective July 20, 2003\u2014the day\n before his return to active duty. In other words, the VA did\n not allow his disability pay to continue until it received no-\n tice of his change in status; once it received notice, it had\n no problem backdating the cessation of benefits. Mr. Buff-\n ington argues that the VA similarly should have no prob-\n lem backdating the recommencement of benefits, once it is\n notified of the date on which a veteran\u2019s active duty ceased.\n      The majority\u2019s focus on Mr. Buffington\u2019s concessions re-\n garding reexamination, reconsideration, and reapplication\n is simply unpersuasive. To the extent the VA implements\n these concepts, they do nothing to rebut the notion that vet-\n erans\u2019 benefits should be continuously administered but for\n any period when active duty pay is received.\n                C. There is no surplusage concern\n     The majority finally contends that reading the \u201cany pe-\n riod\u201d language of \u00a7 5304(c) to \u201cset both the date for discon-\n tinuing benefits and the date for recommencing benefits\n based on active service\u201d renders \u00a7 5112(b)(3) superfluous.\n Maj. Op. at 8. According to the majority, Congress chose to\n define the effective date of the discontinuation of benefits\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62   Page: 23    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON     v. MCDONOUGH                               13\n\n\n\n in \u00a7 5112(b) but not to specify the effective date of recom-\n mencement of disability benefits following a veteran\u2019s pe-\n riod of active service. It claims that construing \u00a7 5304(c)\u2019s\n \u201cany period\u201d language as setting the discontinuance and\n recommencement dates of awards requires reading into the\n statute a \u201cday-before\u201d discontinuance date and a \u201cday-af-\n ter\u201d recommencement date. Since Congress already pro-\n vided a \u201cday-before\u201d discontinuance date in \u00a7 5112(b)(3),\n the majority argues that interpreting \u201cany period\u201d in\n \u00a7 5304(c) to include a \u201cday-before\u201d and a \u201cday-after\u201d effec-\n tive dates would create impermissible surplusage in\n \u00a7 5112(b)(3).\n      The majority\u2019s argument rests on a misinterpretation\n of the statutory text. Section 5304(c)\u2019s \u201cany period\u201d lan-\n guage does not create new effective dates. As discussed\n above, \u00a7\u00a7 5110 and 5112(b)(3) do this by establishing start\n and discontinuance effective dates, respectively. When\n read alongside \u00a7 5112(b)(3), \u00a7 5304(c) merely delineates the\n period of pause in benefits, with \u00a7 5112(b)\u2019s discontinuance\n effective date giving effect to \u00a7 5304(c)\u2019s bar on duplicate\n benefits. It is notable, moreover, that \u00a7 5112(b)(3) actually\n does extra work than the phrase \u201cany period\u201d in \u00a7 5304(c):\n it sets a discontinuance date the day before the period in\n \u00a7 5304(c) commences.       If anything, the existence of\n \u00a7 5112(b)(3) proves that when Congress wanted to set a\n commencement or recommencement date that differed\n from the start and end of the \u201cperiod\u201d referenced in\n \u00a7 5304(c), it knew how to do so expressly.\n   D. Doubt regarding any recommencement date must be\n             resolved in Mr. Buffington\u2019s favor\n     The majority asserts that, because it finds a \u201cstatutory\n gap\u201d regarding the recommencement of benefits, it may ig-\n nore the pro-veteran canon of construction in its Chevron\n step one analysis. But that logic does not withstand dis-\n section. What the majority appears to really say is that, by\n not expressly setting a date for recommencement of\n\fCase: 20-1479     Document: 62      Page: 24    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 14                                 BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n benefits as clearly as it did for a discontinuation of benefits,\n Congress gave the VA the greenlight to finish the statute\n via regulation. Calling what it finds a \u201cstatutory gap\u201d does\n not alter the reality of what the majority concludes, how-\n ever, or what the implications of that conclusion are.\n     As described above, the majority failed to correctly ap-\n ply Chevron\u2019s step one analysis because it found a statutory\n gap in \u00a7 5304(c) without first finding an ambiguity. As part\n of a correct Chevron step one analysis, the majority must\n take into account all other traditional canons of construc-\n tion along the way, including the pro-veteran canon of con-\n struction.

To\n do so is to ignore our job under Chevron. As noted above,\n\n\n\n\n     3   To the extent this court has previously placed con-\n sideration of the Gardner presumption after considerations\n of deference, Kisor II made clear that the inquiry is to be\n done in the reverse order.\n\fCase: 20-1479    Document: 62        Page: 26   Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 16                                  BUFFINGTON   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n there is nothing ambiguous about the \u201cany period\u201d lan-\n guage in \u00a7 5304(c).\n                               II.\n      After finding a gap in \u00a7 5304(c)\u2019s statutory text, the ma-\n jority moves on to Chevron step two. The majority con-\n cludes that 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) is a reasonable gap-\n filling measure because it \u201cincentivizes early filing\u201d of re-\n commencement of benefits, thereby promoting efficiency\n within the VA. Maj. Op. at 10. But requiring veterans to\n reapply for benefits to which they previously were entitled\n seems anything but efficient. If efficiency is paramount,\n then interpreting \u00a7 5304(c) as enacting a pause in benefits\n for \u201cany period\u201d during which a veteran returns to active\n duty better achieves that goal.\n     The majority also reasons that 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2)\u2019s\n requirement of \u201ctimely reapplication\u201d for benefits is reason-\n able because a veteran\u2019s \u201cdisability may improve or worsen\n over time.\u201d Id. Impliedly, the \u201creasonable\u201d functions\n served by \u201creapplication\u201d for benefits involve modifying the\n amount of benefits according to the severity of the veteran\u2019s\n disability.\n     As noted above, several other regulatory and statutory\n mechanisms, however, serve these functions. The VA uses\n reexaminations to monitor the changing levels of a vet-\n eran\u2019s disability and to adjust the award amount based on\n the disability rating. See 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.327(a). And, in the\n event of a veteran\u2019s disability worsening, 38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 5110(b)(3) allows veterans to file claims for increased\n awards. The means of addressing different disability rat-\n ings are thus already baked into the statutory and regula-\n tory framework. They should not muddy our analysis,\n which focuses on whether 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2)\u2019s complex\n benefits scheme comports with the statutory text of Title\n 38\u2019s effective start and discontinuance dates\u2014as well as\n any pauses pursuant to \u00a7 5304(c)\u2019s \u201cany period\u201d language.\n\fCase: 20-1479      Document: 62    Page: 27    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BUFFINGTON     v. MCDONOUGH                                17\n\n\n\n     Quite simply, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.654(b)(2) serves no purpose\n other than to deny disability benefits (and other critical re-\n tirement benefits) to veterans entitled to them solely be-\n cause these men and women answered the call to return to\n active duty. That is wholly inconsistent with the benefi-\n cent scheme in which the relevant statutory provisions ap-\n pear and with the congressional intent behind both the\n VJRA and the AMA. I dissent from the majority\u2019s endorse-\n ment of this offensive regulation.\n\f<\/pre>",

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28\n  U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(6). Because we are unpersuaded by In-\n  gevity\u2019s arguments, we affirm.\n                         BACKGROUND\n                                I.\n       The \u2019844 patent is directed to a method for reducing\n  emissions resulting from gasoline evaporation from auto-\n  mobile fuel systems. \u2019844 patent col. 1 ll. 27\u201334; col. 3 ll.\n  43\u201364. These emissions, which sometimes are referred to\n  as \u201cbleed emissions,\u201d typically occur when a vehicle has\n  been parked and subjected to diurnal temperature changes\n  over a period of several days. Id. col 2 ll. 45\u201346; col. 4 ll.\n  42\u201344. These temperature changes cause pressure fluctu-\n  ations in the vehicle\u2019s fuel tank, which in turn cause gases\n  to flow in and out of the fuel tank vent. Initial Determina-\n  tion, 2020 WL 1026313, at *6. One way to control bleed\n  emissions is via \u201cadsorption\u201d and the storage of hydrocar-\n  bon vapors in a canister, followed by \u201cdesorption,\u201d facili-\n  tated by passing fresh air through the canister to purge the\n  adsorbed hydrocarbons back into the fuel system, where\n  they are burned in the internal combustion process. See id.\n  at *6\u20137; \u2019844 patent col. 1 ll. 32\u201338. In the relevant time\n  period, adsorbents were commonly characterized in terms\n  of their \u201cbutane working capacity,\u201d or \u201cBWC.\u201d BWC de-\n  scribes the inherent ability of materials to adsorb and de-\n  sorb hydrocarbons. See id. col. 2 ll. 1\u201316.\n      The \u2019844 patent describes a method for controlling\n  bleed emissions that uses two adsorbents. The first\n\fCase: 20-1800     Document: 87-2      Page: 5    Filed: 07\/21\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  INGEVITY CORPORATION   v. ITC                                5\n\n\n\n  adsorbent is closer to the fuel source (from which the va-\n  pors are coming) than the second adsorbent, which is closer\n  to the vent (from which the vapors are being emitted). The\n  \u2019844 patent generally describes the adsorption abilities of\n  its two adsorbents in terms of \u201cincremental adsorption ca-\n  pacity\u201d (\u201cIAC\u201d), as opposed to BWC. Although there are\n  differences between how IAC and BWC are calculated, both\n  measure the mass of adsorbate that is adsorbed by a unit\n  of adsorbent at a particular temperature and vapor concen-\n  tration. Initial Determination, 2020 WL 1026313, at *95.\n  The adsorptive properties of an adsorbent can be charac-\n  terized using an \u201cisotherm,\u201d a series of measured adsorp-\n  tion capacities of an adsorbent for various concentrations\n  of an adsorbate at a specific temperature, which can be rep-\n  resented graphically. See id. at *53.\n       The \u2019844 patent describes the first, fuel-side adsorbent\n  as preferably being a \u201cstandard high working capacity car-\n  bon[].\u201d \u2019844 patent col. 3 ll. 46\u201347. The second, vent-side\n  adsorbent preferably \u201cexhibits a flat or flattened adsorbent\n  isotherm on a volumetric basis[,] in addition to certain\n  characteristically desirable adsorptive properties across\n  broad vapor concentrations.\u201d Id. col. 3 ll. 47\u201351. These\n  properties include \u201crelatively low incremental capacity at\n  high concentration vapors compared with the fuel source-\n  side adsorbent volume.\u201d Id. col. 3 ll. 51\u201353. According to\n  the \u2019844 patent, using a vent-side adsorbent with a flatter\n  adsorption isotherm results in \u201cgiv[ing] up less vapor into\n  the purge stream and this purge will then be more efficient\n  in reducing vapor concentrations deeper into the bed.\u201d Id.\n  col. 4 ll. 31\u201355.\n      Claim 1 of the \u2019844 patent is representative. 3 It recites:\n\n\n\n\n      3   Ingevity makes no arguments for claims other than\n  claim 1, so the case rises or falls on that claim.\n\fCase: 20-1800    Document: 87-2        Page: 6   Filed: 07\/21\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  6                                  INGEVITY CORPORATION   v. ITC\n\n\n\n      1. A method for reducing fuel vapor emissions in\n      automotive evaporative emissions control systems\n      comprising the steps of contacting the fuel vapor\n      with an initial adsorbent volume having incremen-\n      tal adsorption capacity at 25\u00ba C. of greater than\n      35 g n-butane\/L between vapor concentrations of 5\n      vol % and 50 vol % n-butane and at least one sub-\n      sequent adsorbent volume having an incremental\n      adsorption capacity of less than 35 g n-butane\/L be-\n      tween vapor concentrations of 5 vol % and 50 vol %\n      n-butane.\n  \u2019844 patent col. 10 ll. 36\u201344. We refer to the two steps of\n  claim 1 as the \u201cfirst adsorbent step\u201d and the \u201csecond adsor-\n  bent step,\u201d respectively.\n                              II.\n      In the 1999\u20132000 timeframe Delphi was working on re-\n  ducing evaporative emissions. This work led to the devel-\n  opment of Delphi\u2019s own fuel canister system (variously\n  referenced in the record as the \u201cDelphi Prior Invention,\u201d\n  \u201cDelphi Epsilon Canister System,\u201d or \u201cDECS\u201d). The parties\n  agree that the Delphi Prior Invention was reduced to prac-\n  tice prior to the \u2019844 patent\u2019s priority date. The Delphi\n  Prior Invention included a conventional carbon canister\n  and an auxiliary canister containing carbon honeycombs.\n  Initial Determination, 2020 WL 1026313, at *89. The Del-\n  phi engineers, Thomas Meiller, Susan LaBine, and Charles\n  Covert, determined that the Delphi Prior Invention im-\n  proved bleed emissions, and sought and received their own\n  patent. Id. at *89, 93; see U.S. Patent No. 6,896,852 to\n  Meiller et al. (\u201cMeiller\u201d). We refer to Mr. Meiller, Dr. La-\n  Bine, and Mr. Covert as the \u201cDelphi Inventors.\u201d\n                              III.\n     In its complaint, Ingevity alleged violation of section\n  337 based upon infringement of claims 1\u20135, 8, 11, 13, 18,\n\fCase: 20-1800    Document: 87-2     Page: 7    Filed: 07\/21\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  INGEVITY CORPORATION   v.

In due\n  course, the Commission instituted proceedings, and the\n  matter was assigned to an ALJ.\n      In the Initial Determination, dated January 28, 2020,\n  the ALJ held that the asserted claims of the \u2019844 patent\n  were anticipated by the Delphi Prior Invention and\/or ob-\n  vious in view of the Delphi Prior Invention or the combina-\n  tion of the Delphi Prior Invention and other references.\n  2020 WL 1026313, at *97.

Id. at *103.\n      Before the ALJ, the parties do not appear to have dis-\n  puted that the Delphi Prior Invention met the first adsor-\n  bent step limitation of claim 1. Considering the second\n  adsorbent step limitation of claim 1, in view of evidence\n  suggesting that the Delphi Inventors were supplied with\n  honeycombs having a BWC of 3.7 g\/dL, the ALJ found it to\n  be \u201ca reasonable inference that the BWC of the honeycombs\n  contained in the DECS would also have been 3.7g\/dL,\u201d\n  which the ALJ found to correlate \u201cto an IAC of under 35\n  g\/L,\u201d thereby satisfying the requirements of the second ad-\n  sorbent step limitation of claim 1.

The Commission determined to review\n  the issue of obviousness over Meiller, Park, and\/or other\n  references, as well as six other issues.

(2) before such person\u2019s invention thereof,\n      the invention was made in this country by another\n      inventor who had not abandoned, suppressed, or\n      concealed it. In determining priority of invention\n      under this subsection, there shall be considered not\n      only the respective dates of conception and reduc-\n      tion to practice of the invention, but also the rea-\n      sonable diligence of one who was first to conceive\n      and last to reduce to practice, from a time prior to\n      conception by the other.\n      In order to establish an actual reduction to practice, the\n  prior inventor must have (1) constructed an embodiment or\n  performed a process that met all the limitations of the\n  claim(s) at issue and (2) determined that the invention\n  would work for its intended purpose.

Mycogen, 243 F.3d at\n  1332\u201333.\n      8   To the extent that counsel for Ingevity suggested\n  otherwise at oral argument, see, e.g., Oral Arg. at 39:13\u2013\n  40:35 (Mar. 4, 2020), available at http:\/\/oralarguments.\n  cafc.uscourts.gov\/default.aspx?fl=20-1800_03042021.mp3,\n  we find this argument to have been waived because it was\n  not set forth in Ingevity\u2019s opening brief. See SmithKline\n  Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp., 439 F.3d 1312, 1319 (Fed.\n  Cir. 2006).\n\fCase: 20-1800    Document: 87-2          Page: 11   Filed: 07\/21\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  INGEVITY CORPORATION   v. ITC                                11\n\n\n\n  that Delphi did not abandon, suppress or conceal its inven-\n  tion. And finally, as noted above, there is no dispute that\n  Delphi\u2019s reduction to practice of the Delphi Prior Invention\n  was prior to Ingevity\u2019s earliest priority date. Instead, In-\n  gevity argues that Intervenors did not meet their burden\n  of establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the\n  Delphi Inventors appreciated that the Delphi Prior Inven-\n  tion included all the limitations of claim 1 of the \u2019844 patent\n  for purposes of establishing a prior reduction to practice,\n  and thus an anticipating prior invention under \u00a7 102(g)(2).\n                                  III.\n       As seen, claim 1 of the \u2019844 patent is a method claim\n  having two steps. The first adsorbent step involves con-\n  tacting the fuel vapor \u201cwith an initial adsorbent volume\n  having incremental adsorbent capacity . . . of greater than\n  35 g n-butane\/L.\u201d In pertinent part, the second adsorbent\n  step is contacting the fuel vapor with \u201cat least one subse-\n  quent adsorbent volume having an incremental adsorption\n  capacity of less than 35 g n-butane\/L.\u201d \u2019844 patent col. 10,\n  ll. 37\u201344. Ingevity\u2019s principal contention on appeal is that\n  the ALJ erred in determining that the Delphi Inventors ap-\n  preciated that the Delphi Prior Invention performed the\n  second adsorbent step. According to Ingevity, without hav-\n  ing contemporaneously recognized and appreciated that\n  step, the Delphi Inventors merely accidentally duplicated\n  the invention defined by the claims of the \u2019844 patent. Spe-\n  cifically, Ingevity argues that nowhere in his Initial Deter-\n  mination did the ALJ \u201cfind (or even suggest)\u201d that the\n  Delphi Inventors appreciated that the honeycombs in the\n  auxiliary canister of the Delphi Prior Invention had an IAC\n  below 35 g\/L. See Appellant\u2019s Br. 30 (\u201cBecause the Delphi\n  engineers never appreciated the claimed limitations\u2014par-\n  ticularly the IAC of the honeycombs in the secondary can-\n  ister\u2014they did not conceive of the invention claimed in the\n  \u2019844 Patent.\u201d); id. at 49\u201350 (\u201c[N]ot having appreciated a\n  subsequent adsorbent volume with an IAC below 35 g\/L,\n  the Delphi engineers did not conceive of or appreciate the\n\fCase: 20-1800    Document: 87-2      Page: 12   Filed: 07\/21\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  12                                INGEVITY CORPORATION   v.

See Mycogen, 243\n  F.3d at 1336. We conclude, however, that substantial evi-\n  dence supports the finding that Intervenors carried that\n  burden.\n      There are several critical pieces of evidence bearing on\n  this point. First is a letter dated October 28, 1999, from\n  James R. Miller, Ph.D., Technical Manager for New\n\n\n\n       9  At oral argument, counsel for Ingevity also argued\n  that the Delphi Inventors needed to appreciate the causa-\n  tive role played by the Delphi Prior Invention\u2019s honey-\n  combs in reducing bleed emissions. See, e.g., Oral Arg. at\n  10:05\u201311:48. Ingevity waived this argument, however, be-\n  cause its briefing was limited to the argument that the Del-\n  phi Inventors did not appreciate that the honeycombs in\n  the Delphi Prior Invention\u2019s auxiliary canister had an IAC\n  below 35 g\/L. See SmithKline Beecham, 439 F.3d at 1319\n  (\u201cOur law is well established that arguments not raised in\n  the opening brief are waived.\u201d).\n\fCase: 20-1800    Document: 87-2     Page: 13    Filed: 07\/21\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  INGEVITY CORPORATION   v.

Dr. LaBine and Mr. Covert, the other two Del-\n  phi Inventors, are copied on the letter. Id. In the letter,\n  Dr. Miller informs Mr. Meiller that he is shipping \u201ctwo de-\n  velopmental honeycomb samples for your work on reducing\n  canister bleed emissions,\u201d and he lists as an attachment to\n  the letter the \u201cbasic properties\u201d that Westvaco had meas-\n  ured for the two honeycomb samples. Id. Among the \u201cbasic\n  properties\u201d listed is \u201cVolumetric Butane Working Capacity,\n  g\/[dL]\u201d of \u201c3.7.\u201d J.A. 11161. A second piece of evidence is a\n  letter dated December 7, 1999, from Dr. Miller to Mr.\n  Meiller, and again copying Dr. LaBine and Mr. Covert.\n  J.A. 11162. The letter indicates that \u201c[a]s requested,\u201d\n  Westvaco had \u201cshipped to [Mr. Meiller\u2019s] attention six hon-\n  eycomb parts [that] have been given the Sample Number\n  445-S-99.\u201d J.A. 11162\u201363. The letter states that the hon-\n  eycomb parts \u201cwere made with the same carbon, formation\n  and cell density as the previous parts [Mr. Meiller] tested.\u201d\n  Id. The last piece of evidence is the physical auxiliary can-\n  ister of the Delphi Prior Invention, which was produced at\n  the deposition of Dr. LaBine. The canister has a tag indi-\n  cating that the honeycombs inside are sample number 445-\n  S-99. 2020 WL 1026313, at *89.\n       As noted, based upon this evidence, the ALJ found it\n  to be a \u201creasonable inference\u201d that the honeycombs con-\n  tained in the Delphi Prior Invention also would have had a\n  BWC of 3.7 g\/dL, Initial Determination, 2020 WL 1026313,\n  at *89, which the ALJ found to correlate to the IAC of below\n  35g\/L required in the second adsorbent step limitation of\n  claim 1. Id. at *96. We believe that the two letters and the\n  physical auxiliary canister constitute substantial evidence\n  that the Delphi Inventors appreciated that the honeycombs\n  of the Delphi Prior Invention had the pertinent adsorptive\n  capacity, regardless of whether they were defined in terms\n  of BWC or IAC. See Dow Chem., 267 F.3d at 1341.

See My-\n  cogen, 243 F.3d at 1337 (\u201cAlthough the amount of evidence\n  regarding appreciation of each specific claim limitation is\n  not extensive, we find that it is legally satisfactory, partic-\n  ularly in light of the extensive evidence establishing that\n  Monsanto performed a process that met all of the limita-\n  tions of the claims, and that the resulting product was suc-\n  cessfully tested and appreciated to work for its intended\n  purpose.\u201d); see also Invitrogen Corp. v. Clontech Labs., Inc.,\n  429 F.3d 1052, 1064 (Fed.

But we think that the ALJ\n  did so find. The ALJ found: \u201cThe record shows that the\n  individuals associated with the DECS sufficiently appreci-\n  ated their invention under 102(g)(2).\u201d Initial Determina-\n  tion, 2020 WL 1026313, at *90; see also id. at 93. In view\n  of the substantial evidence illustrating the Delphi Inven-\n  tors\u2019 appreciation that the honeycombs of the Delphi Prior\n  Invention\u2019s auxiliary canister had the pertinent adsorptive\n  capacity discussed above, we read the ALJ\u2019s statement as\n  making the finding that Ingevity says is missing.\n                                V.\n      In its second argument on appeal, Ingevity requests\n  that we \u201cmake clear\u201d that the determinations of the ALJ\n  that the Commission chose to review, but with respect to\n  which the Commission ultimately took no position, are va-\n  cated by operation of law.

Because we are unpersuaded by In-\n  gevity\u2019s arguments, we affirm.\n                         BACKGROUND\n                                I.\n       The \u2019844 patent is directed to a method for reducing\n  emissions resulting from gasoline evaporation from auto-\n  mobile fuel systems. \u2019844 patent col. 1 ll. 27\u201334; col. 3 ll.\n  43\u201364. These emissions, which sometimes are referred to\n  as \u201cbleed emissions,\u201d typically occur when a vehicle has\n  been parked and subjected to diurnal temperature changes\n  over a period of several days. Id. col 2 ll. 45\u201346; col. 4 ll.\n  42\u201344. These temperature changes cause pressure fluctu-\n  ations in the vehicle\u2019s fuel tank, which in turn cause gases\n  to flow in and out of the fuel tank vent. Initial Determina-\n  tion, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2020 WL 1026313<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6. One way to control bleed\n  emissions is via \u201cadsorption\u201d and the storage of hydrocar-\n  bon vapors in a canister, followed by \u201cdesorption,\u201d facili-\n  tated by passing fresh air through the canister to purge the\n  adsorbed hydrocarbons back into the fuel system, where\n  they are burned in the internal combustion process. See <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.\n  at *6<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">\u20137; \u2019844 patent col. 1 ll. 32\u201338. In the relevant time\n  period, adsorbents were commonly characterized in terms\n  of their \u201cbutane working capacity,\u201d or \u201cBWC.\u201d BWC de-\n  scribes the inherent ability of materials to adsorb and de-\n  sorb hydrocarbons. See <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.<\/span><pre class=\"inline\"> col. 2 ll. 1\u201316.\n      The \u2019844 patent describes a method for controlling\n  bleed emissions that uses two adsorbents.

The\n  \u2019844 patent generally describes the adsorption abilities of\n  its two adsorbents in terms of \u201cincremental adsorption ca-\n  pacity\u201d (\u201cIAC\u201d), as opposed to BWC. Although there are\n  differences between how IAC and BWC are calculated, both\n  measure the mass of adsorbate that is adsorbed by a unit\n  of adsorbent at a particular temperature and vapor concen-\n  tration. Initial Determination, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2020 WL 1026313<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *95.\n  The adsorptive properties of an adsorbent can be charac-\n  terized using an \u201cisotherm,\u201d a series of measured adsorp-\n  tion capacities of an adsorbent for various concentrations\n  of an adsorbate at a specific temperature, which can be rep-\n  resented graphically. See <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at *53<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n       The \u2019844 patent describes the first, fuel-side adsorbent\n  as preferably being a \u201cstandard high working capacity car-\n  bon[].\u201d \u2019844 patent col. 3 ll. 46\u201347. The second, vent-side\n  adsorbent preferably \u201cexhibits a flat or flattened adsorbent\n  isotherm on a volumetric basis[,] in addition to certain\n  characteristically desirable adsorptive properties across\n  broad vapor concentrations.\u201d <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.<\/span><pre class=\"inline\"> col. 3 ll. 47\u201351.

According to\n  the \u2019844 patent, using a vent-side adsorbent with a flatter\n  adsorption isotherm results in \u201cgiv[ing] up less vapor into\n  the purge stream and this purge will then be more efficient\n  in reducing vapor concentrations deeper into the bed.\u201d <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">\n  col. 4 ll. 31\u201355.\n      Claim 1 of the \u2019844 patent is representative. 3 It recites:\n\n\n\n\n      3   Ingevity makes no arguments for claims other than\n  claim 1, so the case rises or falls on that claim.\n\fCase: 20-1800    Document: 87-2        Page: 6   Filed: 07\/21\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  6                                  INGEVITY CORPORATION   v.

The parties\n  agree that the Delphi Prior Invention was reduced to prac-\n  tice prior to the \u2019844 patent\u2019s priority date.

In due\n  course, the Commission instituted proceedings, and the\n  matter was assigned to an ALJ.\n      In the Initial Determination, dated January 28, 2020,\n  the ALJ held that the asserted claims of the \u2019844 patent\n  were anticipated by the Delphi Prior Invention and\/or ob-\n  vious in view of the Delphi Prior Invention or the combina-\n  tion of the Delphi Prior Invention and other references.\n  <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2020 WL 1026313<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *97. The ALJ also held, inter alia,\n  that the asserted claims were rendered obvious over\n  Meiller and\/or U.S. Patent No. 5,914,294 to Park et al.\n  (\u201cPark\u201d) and other references. <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at *103<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n      Before the ALJ, the parties do not appear to have dis-\n  puted that the Delphi Prior Invention met the first adsor-\n  bent step limitation of claim 1. Considering the second\n  adsorbent step limitation of claim 1, in view of evidence\n  suggesting that the Delphi Inventors were supplied with\n  honeycombs having a BWC of 3.7 g\/dL, the ALJ found it to\n  be \u201ca reasonable inference that the BWC of the honeycombs\n  contained in the DECS would also have been 3.7g\/dL,\u201d\n  which the ALJ found to correlate \u201cto an IAC of under 35\n  g\/L,\u201d thereby satisfying the requirements of the second ad-\n  sorbent step limitation of claim 1.

And finally, as noted above, there is no dispute that\n  Delphi\u2019s reduction to practice of the Delphi Prior Invention\n  was prior to Ingevity\u2019s earliest priority date. Instead, In-\n  gevity argues that Intervenors did not meet their burden\n  of establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the\n  Delphi Inventors appreciated that the Delphi Prior Inven-\n  tion included all the limitations of claim 1 of the \u2019844 patent\n  for purposes of establishing a prior reduction to practice,\n  and thus an anticipating prior invention under \u00a7 102(g)(2).\n                                  III.\n       As seen, claim 1 of the \u2019844 patent is a method claim\n  having two steps. The first adsorbent step involves con-\n  tacting the fuel vapor \u201cwith an initial adsorbent volume\n  having incremental adsorbent capacity . . . of greater than\n  35 g n-butane\/L.\u201d In pertinent part, the second adsorbent\n  step is contacting the fuel vapor with \u201cat least one subse-\n  quent adsorbent volume having an incremental adsorption\n  capacity of less than 35 g n-butane\/L.\u201d \u2019844 patent col. 10,\n  ll. 37\u201344. Ingevity\u2019s principal contention on appeal is that\n  the ALJ erred in determining that the Delphi Inventors ap-\n  preciated that the Delphi Prior Invention performed the\n  second adsorbent step. According to Ingevity, without hav-\n  ing contemporaneously recognized and appreciated that\n  step, the Delphi Inventors merely accidentally duplicated\n  the invention defined by the claims of the \u2019844 patent. Spe-\n  cifically, Ingevity argues that nowhere in his Initial Deter-\n  mination did the ALJ \u201cfind (or even suggest)\u201d that the\n  Delphi Inventors appreciated that the honeycombs in the\n  auxiliary canister of the Delphi Prior Invention had an IAC\n  below 35 g\/L.

We conclude, however, that substantial evi-\n  dence supports the finding that Intervenors carried that\n  burden.\n      There are several critical pieces of evidence bearing on\n  this point. First is a letter dated October 28, 1999, from\n  James R. Miller, Ph.D., Technical Manager for New\n\n\n\n       9  At oral argument, counsel for Ingevity also argued\n  that the Delphi Inventors needed to appreciate the causa-\n  tive role played by the Delphi Prior Invention\u2019s honey-\n  combs in reducing bleed emissions. See, e.g., Oral Arg. at\n  10:05\u201311:48.

Straw appeals from two decisions of the\n United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cClaims Court\u201d). In\n appeal number 21-1600, he appeals from a decision of the\n Claims Court dismissing his alleged takings claims for lack\n of subject matter jurisdiction. See Straw v. United States,\n Dkt. No. 21, No. 20-cv-1157 (Fed. Cl. Jan. 12, 2021). In\n appeal number 21-1602, he appeals the Claims Court\u2019s de-\n nial of his motion to proceed in forma pauperis in a sepa-\n rate action. See Straw v. United States, Dkt. No. 9, No. 21-\n cv-745 (Fed. Cl. Jan. 22, 2021). Additionally, in both of\n these appeals, Mr. Straw requests that this court rescind\n the Anti-Filing Order which the Claims Court imposed in\n case number 20-1157 and remove the Claims Court judge.\n As the issues raised in these appeals overlap, we address\n them in this consolidated opinion. See Straw v. United\n States, Dkt. No. 22, No. 20-cv-1157 (Fed. Cl. Jan. 12, 2021).\n We affirm as to both decisions.\n\fCase: 21-1600       Document: 25   Page: 3    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n STRAW   v. US                                               3\n\n\n\n       I.        MR. STRAW\u2019S ABRIDGED LITIGATION HISTORY\n     Mr. Straw has an extensive litigation history, including\n several appeals before this court. We briefly summarize\n some relevant portions of that history here.\n     In 2017, the Claims Court dismissed Mr. Straw\u2019s com-\n plaint alleging a Fifth Amendment taking premised on his\n alleged indirect exposure to toxic chemicals carried home\n on his father\u2019s clothing from his father\u2019s job repairing heli-\n copters at the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida.\n Straw v. United States, 710 F. App\u2019x 881, 882 (Fed. Cir.\n 2017). The Claims Court found that Mr. Straw\u2019s complaint\n sounded in tort, which is specifically excluded from the\n Claims Court\u2019s jurisdiction. Id. This court affirmed. Id.\n     Another of Mr. Straw\u2019s complaints, this time to the\n United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, al-\n leged that he was entitled to compensation under the Hon-\n oring America\u2019s Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune\n Families Act, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1787, for injuries allegedly\n caused by contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. Straw v.\n Wilkie, 843 F. App\u2019x 263, 264 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Mr. Straw\n alleged that he qualified for benefits because he and his\n mother regularly visited Camp Lejeune and he was present\n at Camp Lejeune for at least thirty days while in utero and\n after his birth. Id. He also asserted a Fifth Amendment\n equal protection claim. Id. at 265. This court affirmed the\n Veterans Court\u2019s decision that Mr. Straw was not entitled\n to benefits because he and his mother lived in an off-base\n residence and thus did not meet the Act\u2019s requirement that\n beneficiaries or their parents have resided at Camp\n Lejeune for at least thirty days. Id. at 266\u201367. This court\n also rejected Mr. Straw\u2019s Fifth Amendment equal protec-\n tion claim, finding that Mr. Straw had not established a\n lack of rational basis for the statutory residence classifica-\n tion. Id. at 267.\n    Another of Mr. Straw\u2019s complaints to the Claims Court\n sought $6,000,000 for an alleged taking committed by a\n\fCase: 21-1600     Document: 25     Page: 4    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  4                                                STRAW   v. US\n\n\n\n district court when it dismissed his tort claim premised on\n his alleged exposure to contaminated water at Camp\n Lejeune. Straw v. United States, No. 2021-1596, 2021 WL\n 2944400, at *1 (Fed. Cir. July 14, 2021). The Claims Court\n dismissed his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdic-\n tion as it lacks jurisdiction to review decisions of district\n courts. Id. This court found Mr. Straw\u2019s appeal of that\n decision to be frivolous. Id. at *2. We affirmed the Claims\n Court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction to review district court determi-\n nations and confirmed that lost tort cases cannot be recast\n as takings claims in the Claims Court. Id. at *2\u20133. We also\n noted that Mr. Straw levied unwarranted personal attacks\n against the Claims Court judge and denied his request to\n remove that judge. Id. at *3. Finally, we refused to adju-\n dicate an Anti-Filing Order which the Claims Court en-\n tered in case number 20-1157, 1 as that Order did not\n prevent Mr. Straw\u2019s filing of the case at issue there. Id.\n at *4.\n     In addition to the two instant appeals, Mr. Straw has\n two more appeals on this court\u2019s docket, appeal numbers\n 21-1597 and 21-1598. And he has filed numerous cases be-\n fore other federal courts. Indeed, between 2017 and 2021,\n he has filed at least forty cases in various federal courts.\n 21-1602 App. 1. 2\n                 II.   APPEAL NUMBER 21-1600\n                         A. Background\n     In appeal number 21-1600, Mr. Straw appeals a deci-\n sion of the Claims Court dismissing his complaint for lack\n of subject matter jurisdiction. See Straw v. United States,\n\n\n      1 The Anti-Filing Order is also at issue in the instant\n appeals.\n     2  All Appendix citations are to the appendices at-\n tached to the Government\u2019s briefs in the instant appeals,\n which are identified by their appeal numbers.\n\fCase: 21-1600    Document: 25     Page: 5    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n STRAW   v. US                                             5\n\n\n\n No. 20-1157 (Fed. Cl. Jan. 12, 2021). In his complaint, Mr.\n Straw lists four alleged takings: one from the Second Cir-\n cuit\u2019s dismissal of two of his appeals, one from the Fourth\n Circuit\u2019s dismissal of four of his appeals, one by the Clerk\n of the U.S. Supreme Court, and one from the Small Busi-\n ness Administration\u2019s (\u201cSBA\u201d) denial of his Paycheck Pro-\n tection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) loan application. He places the\n total value of these four alleged takings at\n $22,461,078,250.\n     Mr. Straw alleges that a first taking occurred when the\n Clerk of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\n dismissed two of his appeals for failure to include a co-\n versheet. He alleges that he did include the coversheet. He\n values this alleged taking at $20,000,000.\n     Mr. Straw alleges that a second taking occurred when\n the Clerk of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-\n cuit assigned the same three-judge panel to hear all four of\n his appeals. He alleges that the clerk \u201cpacked [his] appeals\n with hostile judges\u201d and violated Fourth Circuit policy. 21-\n 1600 App. 16. He further states that he believes the Indi-\n ana Supreme Court and other Midwest courts were in-\n volved in the conspiracy. He values this alleged taking at\n $22,291,052,000.\n     Mr. Straw alleges that a third taking occurred when\n the Clerk of the U.S. Supreme Court, Scott Harris, alleg-\n edly \u201crefused to file [Mr. Straw\u2019s] document against the In-\n diana Supreme Court\u201d after the denial of his petition for a\n writ of certiorari and thus \u201cdenied the services of the U.S.\n Supreme Court.\u201d 21-1600 App. 17-18. He values this al-\n leged taking at $150,000,000.\n     Finally, Mr. Straw alleges that a fourth taking oc-\n curred when the SBA denied his request for a PPP loan in\n 2020 in the amount of $26,250. He alleges that the SBA\n denied his loan application on the basis of his failure to\n complete and return required documents, all of which he\n\fCase: 21-1600    Document: 25      Page: 6    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  6                                               STRAW   v. US\n\n\n\n alleges he submitted. He values this alleged taking at\n $26,250.\n     The Claims Court dismissed Mr. Straw\u2019s claims, hold-\n ing that he had failed to concede the validity of the various\n alleged government actions as required to invoke the juris-\n diction of the Claims Court over a takings claim. The same\n day that it dismissed his case, the Claims Court entered an\n Anti-Filing Order based on its finding that Mr. Straw\u2019s\n complaint showed indicia of frivolousness and harassment\n and based on Mr. Straw\u2019s history of raising similar frivo-\n lous claims in the Claims Court and other federal courts.\n     Mr. Straw appealed the Claims Court\u2019s dismissal of his\n case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the Claims\n Court\u2019s imposition of an Anti-Filing Order to this court. We\n have jurisdiction to review final decisions from the Claims\n Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).\n                         B. Discussion\n      On appeal, Mr. Straw appears to request that this\n court reverse the Claims Court\u2019s dismissal for lack of sub-\n ject matter jurisdiction, rescind the Anti-Filing Order, and\n remove the Claims Court judge. He raises the same com-\n plaints regarding the Anti-Filing Order and the alleged\n bias of the judge in both appeals addressed by this consoli-\n dated opinion, so we address them only once in our discus-\n sion of his second appeal, 21-1602, below. We first address\n the Claims Court\u2019 dismissal of case number 20-1157, which\n we hold was not in error.\n      This court reviews Claims Court decisions to dismiss\n for lack of jurisdiction de novo. Campbell v. United States,\n 932 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2019).\n     Subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold issue that\n courts must consider before they consider the merits of a\n claim. Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83,\n 94\u201395 (1998). The plaintiff bears the burden of proving\n subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the\n\fCase: 21-1600    Document: 25      Page: 7    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n STRAW   v. US                                              7\n\n\n\n evidence. Freeman v. United States, 875 F.3d 623, 628\n (Fed. Cir. 2017). In considering a motion to dismiss for lack\n of subject matter jurisdiction, the court accepts as true the\n complaint\u2019s undisputed factual allegations and construes\n the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Ste-\n phens v. United States, 884 F.3d 1151, 1155 (Fed. Cir.\n 2018). Pro se plaintiffs, such as Mr. Straw, have the benefit\n of having their pleadings liberally construed. But that does\n not alleviate their burden to show jurisdiction. See Beltran\n v. Shinseki, 447 F. App\u2019x 208, 209 (Fed. Cir. 2011).\n     The Claims Court\u2019s jurisdiction, if any, over Mr.\n Straw\u2019s case arises under the Tucker Act. 28 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 1491(a). The Tucker Act gives the Claims Court \u201cjuris-\n diction to render judgment upon any claim against the\n United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any\n Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive depart-\n ment, or upon any express or implied contract with the\n United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in\n cases not sounding in tort.\u201d Id. The Tucker Act is \u201ca juris-\n dictional statute; it does not create any substantive right\n enforceable against the United States for money dam-\n ages . . . .\u201d United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 398\n (1976). Thus, \u201ca plaintiff must identify a separate source\n of substantive law that creates the right to money dam-\n ages.\u201d Fisher v. United States, 402 F.3d 1167, 1172 (Fed.\n Cir. 2005) (en banc).\n     For the Claims Court to have jurisdiction over takings\n claims, such as those asserted by Mr. Straw in case number\n 20-1157, the plaintiff must allege that the challenged gov-\n ernment actions were not ultra vires. Government officials\n acting ultra vires cannot effect takings for public purposes\n within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. \u201cA compen-\n sable taking arises only if the government action in ques-\n tion is authorized.\u201d Del-Rio Drilling Programs v. United\n States, 146 F.3d 1358, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Unauthorized\n takings may be enjoinable, but they are not entitled to com-\n pensation under the Fifth Amendment. Id.\n\fCase: 21-1600     Document: 25     Page: 8    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  8                                                STRAW   v. US\n\n\n\n     Mr. Straw argues that the Claims Court committed\n both factual and legal errors that warrant reversal. First,\n he alleges that the Claims Court erred as a matter of law\n by dismissing his case for his failure to concede the validity\n of the federal governmental actions which he alleges con-\n stitute takings. 21-1600 Appellant\u2019s Inf. Br. at 2. Mr.\n Straw states that he has \u201cthe right to object to what hap-\n pened while still conceding that these entities have the\n power to do what they did.\u201d Id. He further states that,\n \u201c[w]hen the government wrongfully uses its power, the use\n of the power is valid even if done for a bad reason.\u201d Id.\n Second, he alleges that the Claims Court made a factual\n error when it stated, \u201cStraw alleges that, in dismissing two\n of his many pending lawsuits, the Second Circuit Clerk\n made false statements or misrepresented the nature of the\n dismissal.\u201d 21-1600 App. 26. Mr. Straw argues that the\n Claims Court\u2019s statement that he had \u201cmany pending law-\n suits\u201d is erroneous because he only had two cases pending\n before the Second Circuit and \u201c2 is not many.\u201d 21-1600 Ap-\n pellant\u2019s Inf. Br. at 1.\n      Mr. Straw did not allege in his complaint facts essen-\n tial to show that the Claims Court had jurisdiction over his\n claims. See McNutt v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., 298\n U.S. 178, 189 (1936) (A plaintiff \u201cmust allege in his plead-\n ing the facts essential to show jurisdiction.\u201d). In his com-\n plaint Mr. Straw alleges facts which, accepted as true for\n the purposes of deciding the Government\u2019s motion to dis-\n miss, fail to provide any basis to find that the various gov-\n ernment actors acted with the authority of the government.\n For example, he alleges that the Fourth Circuit Clerk acted\n \u201coutside the normal policies and procedures of that Court,\u201d\n 21-1600 App. 1 \u00b6 3; that the Fourth Circuit Clerk \u201cpacked\n [his] appeals with hostile judges\u201d in violation of a policy\n \u201cthat panels are supposed to be assigned randomly as to\n avoid improper bias and unfair results,\u201d 21-1600 App. 16\n \u00b6\u00b6 14\u201317; that the Second Circuit Clerk dismissed his ap-\n peals before that court \u201cfor a reason that was false,\u201d 21-\n\fCase: 21-1600     Document: 25     Page: 9    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n STRAW   v. US                                               9\n\n\n\n 1600 App. 15 \u00b6 6; that the Supreme Court Clerk refused to\n file a document based on incorrect legal arguments, 21-\n 1600 App. 17 \u00b6 24; and that the SBA \u201crepeatedly . . . asked\n for the same documents\u201d which Mr. Straw avers he had al-\n ready filed, 21-1600 App. 18 \u00b6 27. An action may be illegal\n or against stated policy and still be an authorized action\n which can effect a taking. Del-Rio, 146 F.3d at 1362. But\n here, Mr. Straw has alleged no facts to show that the al-\n leged conduct was authorized at all. And his assertions\n that the complained-of conduct was against stated govern-\n ment policy, without more, naturally lead to the opposite\n conclusion\u2014that the conduct was not authorized.\n     In Mr. Straw\u2019s complaint to the Claims Court, he ap-\n pears to conclude that the various government actors had\n authority to dismiss his myriad claims and deny his loan\n application, but with the caveat that he does so only for this\n case and \u201cshould be able to interpret these actions differ-\n ently elsewhere as it suits\u201d him. 21-1600 App. 3. He states:\n \u201cI fully accept for the purposes of my case here that the\n clerks and the ABA [sic] had the power to do what they did,\n but that does not excuse the takings without compensating\n them.\u201d 21-1600 App. 3. The Claims Court is required to\n take all undisputed facts alleged in the complaint as true\n but need not take as true a \u201clegal conclusion couched as a\n factual allegation,\u201d such as Mr. Straw\u2019s half-hearted con-\n clusion here. See Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286\n (1986).\n     Even if we were to disagree with the Claims Court\u2019s\n stated reason for dismissing Mr. Straw\u2019s appeals, there are\n other grounds for dismissal. Mr. Straw\u2019s claims based on\n the actions of other circuit courts and the Supreme Court\n effectively ask the Claims Court to review the acts of other\n Article III courts, a task for which the Claims Court does\n not have jurisdiction. See Straw, 2021 WL 2944400, at *1\u2013\n 2. Nor could the Claims Court review the actions of the\n SBA where Mr. Straw has not exhausted his administra-\n tive remedies. See JCM, Ltd. v. United States, 210 F.3d\n\fCase: 21-1600    Document: 25     Page: 10   Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  10                                             STRAW   v. US\n\n\n\n 1357, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Further, Mr. Straw does not\n have a vested property right in the outcome of his claims\n before any of the federal courts about which he complains\n or in the grant of a PPP loan from the SBA for which com-\n pensation might be owed under the Fifth Amendment. See\n Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 266 (1994)\n (\u201cThe Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause prevents the\n Legislature (and other government actors) from depriving\n private persons of vested property rights except for a \u2018pub-\n lic use\u2019 and upon payment of \u2018just compensation.\u2019\u201d).\n     Mr. Straw\u2019s alleged factual error, that the Claims\n Court erroneously stated that he had \u201cmany pending law-\n suits\u201d when he avers that he only had two cases pending\n before the Second Circuit, is immaterial to the Claims\n Court decision on appeal here. The Claims Court found\n that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Mr.\n Straw failed to concede the validity of the government ac-\n tions that were the basis of his alleged takings claims, not\n because of the number of Mr. Straw\u2019s pending cases. 21-\n 1600 App. at 2.\n     Thus, we conclude that the Claims Court did not err in\n dismissing Mr. Straw\u2019s case number 20-1157. We address\n Mr. Straw\u2019s requests that this court rescind the Anti-Filing\n Order and remove the Claims Court judge below.\n                III.   APPEAL NUMBER 21-1602\n                        A. Background\n      In appeal number 21-1602, Mr. Straw appeals the de-\n cision of the Claims Court in Straw v. United States, No.\n 21-745 (Fed. Cl. Jan. 22, 2021) denying his motion to pro-\n ceed in forma pauperis and requiring him to pay a $402\n filing fee. In this case, Mr. Straw seeks compensation of\n $12,000,000 for an alleged Fifth Amendment taking stem-\n ming from the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of twelve of his pe-\n titions for certiorari between January 2015 and June 2018.\n The Claims Court denied Mr. Straw\u2019s motion to proceed in\n\fCase: 21-1600    Document: 25     Page: 11    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n STRAW   v. US                                             11\n\n\n\n forma pauperis for the same reasons outlined in the Anti-\n Filing Order that the Court entered in case number\n 20-1157, which is the subject of appeal number 21-1600.\n     Denial \u201cof a motion to proceed in forma pauperis is an\n appealable order.\u201d Roberts v. U.S. Dist. Ct., 339 U.S. 844,\n 845 (1950) (citing Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp.,\n 337 U.S. 541 (1949)). Thus, this court has jurisdiction un-\n der 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3) to review the Claims Court\u2019s de-\n nial of permission to proceed in forma pauperis.\n     \u201cDenials of in forma pauperis status are reviewed for\n abuse of discretion.\u201d Fourstar v. United States, 950 F.3d\n 856, 858 (Fed. Cir. 2020). Section 1915(a) of Title 28 of the\n United States Code permits, but does not require, federal\n courts to allow indigent parties to proceed in forma pau-\n peris without prepaying fees or paying certain expenses.\n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915; see also Coleman v. Tollefson, 575 U.S.\n 532, 534 (2015); Chamberlain v. United States, 655 F.\n App\u2019x 822, 825 (Fed. Cir. 2016).\n     Similarly, we review a court\u2019s decision to impose an\n anti-filing order for abuse of discretion. See Chambers v.\n NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 44\u201345 (1991) (recognizing that\n courts\u2019 \u201cinherent powers must be exercised with restraint\n and discretion\u201d and that \u201c[a] primary aspect of that discre-\n tion is the ability to fashion an appropriate sanction for\n conduct which abuses the judicial process\u201d); Hemphill v.\n Kimberly-Clark Corp., 374 F. App\u2019x 41, 44 (Fed. Cir. 2010)\n (\u201cA court's decision to impose an anti-filing injunction is\n also reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d).\n                         B. Discussion\n     In this appeal, Mr. Straw appears to argue for the re-\n versal of the Claims Court\u2019s denial of his motion to proceed\n in forma pauperis. He also repeats his requests from ap-\n peal number 21-1600 and other appeals before this court to\n rescind the Anti-Filing Order and to remove the Claims\n Court judge. See Straw, 2021 WL 2944400, at *3\u20134.\n\fCase: 21-1600       Document: 25    Page: 12   Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  12                                               STRAW   v. US\n\n\n\n           1. Denial of Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis\n      Mr. Straw argues that the Claims Court erred because\n it granted his motions to proceed in forma pauperis in four\n prior cases but denied his motion in this case despite there\n being no change in his financial status. He argues that the\n Claims Court was required to find his case frivolous before\n denying his motion, something which the Claims Court did\n not expressly do. 3\n      The Claims Court did not abuse its discretion in deny-\n ing Mr. Straw\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis.\n Courts have discretion to limit a party\u2019s permission to pro-\n ceed in forma pauperis where they have exhibited a history\n of frivolous or abusive filings. See, e.g., Martin v. D.C. Ct.\n of Appeals, 506 U.S. 1, 3 (1992) (denying a petitioner\u2019s re-\n quest to proceed in forma pauperis due to voluminous and\n abusive filing history); In re Sindram, 498 U.S. 177, 180\n (1991) (\u201c[T]he Court has a duty to deny in forma pauperis\n status to those individuals who have abused the system.\u201d);\n In re McDonald, 489 U.S. 180, 183\u201385 (1989) (denying pe-\n titioner\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and limiting\n petitioner\u2019s ability to proceed in forma pauperis in future\n petitions for extraordinary writs based on petitioner's\n abuse of judicial resources). A motion to proceed in forma\n pauperis should not be denied lightly. Denying an indigent\n party\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis may effectively\n cut off their access to the court. But, here, the Claims\n Court did not abuse its discretion.\n     Multiple courts, including this one, have found Mr.\n Straw\u2019s cases frivolous. See Straw, 2021 WL 2944400,\n\n\n\n       3  The Claims Court expressly found that Mr. Straw\u2019s\n \u201clitigation history of filing frivolous, repetitive, and vexa-\n tious actions weigh heavily against granting\u201d his motion to\n proceed in forma pauperis but never expressly identified\n the instant case as frivolous. 21-1602 App. at 21.\n\fCase: 21-1600    Document: 25     Page: 13    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n STRAW   v. US                                             13\n\n\n\n at *1. The Claims Court found that Mr. Straw has filed at\n least forty federal cases in the four years preceding its in-\n stitution of the Anti-Filing Order in January 2021.\n 21-1602 App. 1. Included in those forty are four cases that\n Mr. Straw filed in the Claims Court over the course of two\n weeks in August and September of 2020. After granting\n the government\u2019s motions to dismiss in each of those four\n cases, the Claims Court instituted an Anti-Filing Order in\n case number 20-1157, one of the cases on appeal here. In\n that Order, the Claims Court found that Mr. Straw \u201chas\n repeatedly raised similar, frivolous claims in this Court\n and other federal courts,\u201d and that \u201ceach case reviewed has\n been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or as frivolous.\u201d\n 21-1602 App. 1. This court has similarly found that Mr.\n Straw has filed \u201ca large number of meritless filings . . . in\n the Claims Court and other courts during the past several\n years.\u201d Straw, 2021 WL 2944400, at *4. The Claims Court\n did not abuse its discretion to deny Mr. Straw\u2019s motion to\n proceed in forma pauperis considering his history of frivo-\n lous filing.\n     Mr. Straw argues that his motion to proceed in forma\n pauperis should have been granted due to his economic sta-\n tus. But a court is not constrained to only consideration of\n economic status in determining whether to grant a motion\n to proceed in forma pauperis. Section 1915 permits, but\n does not require, a court to allow a party to proceed without\n paying the requisite fees if \u201cthe person is unable to pay\n such fees or give security therefor.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1);\n see also Chamberlain, 655 F. App\u2019x at 825.\n     Mr. Straw also argues that the Claims Court must find\n the instant case frivolous, rather than rely on a history of\n frivolous filings, before it may deny a motion to proceed in\n forma pauperis. This is incorrect. The Claims Court is free\n to consider a history of frivolous filing in determining\n whether to grant a motion to proceed in forma pauperis.\n See, e.g., Martin, 506 U.S. at 3 (denying motion to proceed\n in forma pauperis based on history of frivolous filing).\n\fCase: 21-1600    Document: 25      Page: 14    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  14                                               STRAW   v. US\n\n\n\n Even if the Claims Court were required to consider the fri-\n volity of the complaint in this case, it could easily find the\n complaint frivolous on its face.          Mr. Straw seeks\n $12,000,000 in compensation for the Supreme Court\u2019s de-\n nial of twelve petitions for certiorari. As previously noted,\n the Claims Court has no jurisdiction to review decisions of\n the Supreme Court and, thus, no power to grant Mr. Straw\n the remedy he seeks.\n                      2. Anti-Filing Order\n      This court has previously abstained from deciding\n whether the imposition of the Anti-Filing Order was an\n abuse of discretion because the Order did not prevent filing\n of the case that was the subject of that prior appeal. Straw,\n 2021 WL 2944400, at *4. Although the Anti-Filing Order\n similarly did not prevent filing of either of the cases on ap-\n peal, the Claims Court entered the order as part of case\n number 20-1157, which is on appeal here in appeal number\n 21-1600. The Claims Court also incorporated its reasoning\n in the Anti-Filing Order as the basis of the denial of Mr.\n Straw\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis in case num-\n ber 21-745, also on appeal here in appeal number 21-1602.\n Thus, we address the imposition of the Anti-Filing Order\n on the merits here.\n      We find no abuse of discretion in the Claims Court\u2019s\n imposition of the Anti-Filing Order on the record before us\n for the same reasons discussed above with respect to the\n Claims Court\u2019s denial of Mr. Straw\u2019s motion to proceed in\n forma pauperis. Mr. Straw does not explain why the Anti-\n Filing Order is contrary to law, beyond baldly asserting\n that it is \u201ccontrary to law and the precedents of this Court.\u201d\n 21-1600 Appellant\u2019s Inf. Br. at 3. Thus, Mr. Straw has pro-\n vided no reason for this court to rescind the Anti-Filing Or-\n der.\n\fCase: 21-1600    Document: 25     Page: 15   Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n STRAW   v. US                                            15\n\n\n\n         3. Removal of the Presiding Claims Court Judge\n     In both of his appeals, Mr. Straw requests that this\n court remove the Claims Court judge who adjudicated his\n cases, alleging political bias. As this court found with re-\n spect to another of Mr. Straw\u2019s appeals raising the same\n allegations against the same Claims Court judge, this\n claim has no merit. Straw, 2021 WL 2944400, at *3. The\n identity of the President who appointed a judge has no\n bearing on whether a judge should recuse themselves. Id.\n Mr. Straw\u2019s allegations against the Claims Court judge are\n unwarranted and personal. See id. at *1. We note, moreo-\n ver, that, since we are affirming the Claims Court\u2019s dismis-\n sal in case number 20-1157, and not remanding anything\n to that court, there are no further matters to be addressed\n in that case. In the absence of Mr. Straw\u2019s payment of the\n required filing fee in case number 21-745, there may well\n be no further activities in that case as well.\n                       IV.    CONCLUSION\n     For the reasons above, we affirm the Claims Court\u2019s\n dismissal of case number 20-1157 for lack of jurisdiction.\n We affirm the Claims Court\u2019s denial of Mr. Straw\u2019s request\n to proceed in forma pauperis in case number 21-745 and\n remand that matter to the Claims Court for further pro-\n ceedings. For the same reasons, we affirm the Claims\n Court\u2019s imposition of an Anti-Filing Order in case number\n 20-1157. We reject Mr. Straw\u2019s request to remove the\n Claims Court judge that adjudicated these two cases.\n                        AFFIRMED\n                             COSTS\n No costs.\n\f",

Straw appeals from two decisions of the\n United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cClaims Court\u201d). In\n appeal number 21-1600, he appeals from a decision of the\n Claims Court dismissing his alleged takings claims for lack\n of subject matter jurisdiction. See Straw v. United States,\n Dkt. No. 21, No. 20-cv-1157 (Fed. Cl. Jan. 12, 2021). In\n appeal number 21-1602, he appeals the Claims Court\u2019s de-\n nial of his motion to proceed in forma pauperis in a sepa-\n rate action. See Straw v. United States, Dkt. No. 9, No. 21-\n cv-745 (Fed. Cl. Jan. 22, 2021). Additionally, in both of\n these appeals, Mr. Straw requests that this court rescind\n the Anti-Filing Order which the Claims Court imposed in\n case number 20-1157 and remove the Claims Court judge.\n As the issues raised in these appeals overlap, we address\n them in this consolidated opinion. See Straw v. United\n States, Dkt. No. 22, No. 20-cv-1157 (Fed. Cl. Jan. 12, 2021).\n We affirm as to both decisions.\n\fCase: 21-1600       Document: 25   Page: 3    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n STRAW   v. US                                               3\n\n\n\n       I.        MR. STRAW\u2019S ABRIDGED LITIGATION HISTORY\n     Mr. Straw has an extensive litigation history, including\n several appeals before this court. We briefly summarize\n some relevant portions of that history here.\n     In 2017, the Claims Court dismissed Mr. Straw\u2019s com-\n plaint alleging a Fifth Amendment taking premised on his\n alleged indirect exposure to toxic chemicals carried home\n on his father\u2019s clothing from his father\u2019s job repairing heli-\n copters at the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida.\n Straw v. United States, 710 F. App\u2019x 881, 882 (Fed. Cir.\n 2017). The Claims Court found that Mr. Straw\u2019s complaint\n sounded in tort, which is specifically excluded from the\n Claims Court\u2019s jurisdiction. Id. This court affirmed. Id.\n     Another of Mr. Straw\u2019s complaints, this time to the\n United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, al-\n leged that he was entitled to compensation under the Hon-\n oring America\u2019s Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune\n Families Act, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1787, for injuries allegedly\n caused by contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. Straw v.\n Wilkie, 843 F. App\u2019x 263, 264 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Mr. Straw\n alleged that he qualified for benefits because he and his\n mother regularly visited Camp Lejeune and he was present\n at Camp Lejeune for at least thirty days while in utero and\n after his birth. Id. He also asserted a Fifth Amendment\n equal protection claim. Id. at 265. This court affirmed the\n Veterans Court\u2019s decision that Mr. Straw was not entitled\n to benefits because he and his mother lived in an off-base\n residence and thus did not meet the Act\u2019s requirement that\n beneficiaries or their parents have resided at Camp\n Lejeune for at least thirty days.

In his complaint, Mr.\n Straw lists four alleged takings: one from the Second Cir-\n cuit\u2019s dismissal of two of his appeals, one from the Fourth\n Circuit\u2019s dismissal of four of his appeals, one by the Clerk\n of the U.S. Supreme Court, and one from the Small Busi-\n ness Administration\u2019s (\u201cSBA\u201d) denial of his Paycheck Pro-\n tection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) loan application. He places the\n total value of these four alleged takings at\n $22,461,078,250.\n     Mr. Straw alleges that a first taking occurred when the\n Clerk of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\n dismissed two of his appeals for failure to include a co-\n versheet. He alleges that he did include the coversheet. He\n values this alleged taking at $20,000,000.\n     Mr. Straw alleges that a second taking occurred when\n the Clerk of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-\n cuit assigned the same three-judge panel to hear all four of\n his appeals. He alleges that the clerk \u201cpacked [his] appeals\n with hostile judges\u201d and violated Fourth Circuit policy. 21-\n <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">1600 App. 16<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">. He further states that he believes the Indi-\n ana Supreme Court and other Midwest courts were in-\n volved in the conspiracy.

He alleges that the SBA\n denied his loan application on the basis of his failure to\n complete and return required documents, all of which he\n\fCase: 21-1600    Document: 25      Page: 6    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  6                                               STRAW   v.

He values this alleged taking at\n $26,250.\n     The Claims Court dismissed Mr. Straw\u2019s claims, hold-\n ing that he had failed to concede the validity of the various\n alleged government actions as required to invoke the juris-\n diction of the Claims Court over a takings claim. The same\n day that it dismissed his case, the Claims Court entered an\n Anti-Filing Order based on its finding that Mr. Straw\u2019s\n complaint showed indicia of frivolousness and harassment\n and based on Mr. Straw\u2019s history of raising similar frivo-\n lous claims in the Claims Court and other federal courts.\n     Mr. Straw appealed the Claims Court\u2019s dismissal of his\n case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the Claims\n Court\u2019s imposition of an Anti-Filing Order to this court. We\n have jurisdiction to review final decisions from the Claims\n Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).\n                         B. Discussion\n      On appeal, Mr. Straw appears to request that this\n court reverse the Claims Court\u2019s dismissal for lack of sub-\n ject matter jurisdiction, rescind the Anti-Filing Order, and\n remove the Claims Court judge. He raises the same com-\n plaints regarding the Anti-Filing Order and the alleged\n bias of the judge in both appeals addressed by this consoli-\n dated opinion, so we address them only once in our discus-\n sion of his second appeal, 21-1602, below. We first address\n the Claims Court\u2019 dismissal of case number 20-1157, which\n we hold was not in error.\n      This court reviews Claims Court decisions to dismiss\n for lack of jurisdiction de novo.

Denial of Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis\n      Mr. Straw argues that the Claims Court erred because\n it granted his motions to proceed in forma pauperis in four\n prior cases but denied his motion in this case despite there\n being no change in his financial status. He argues that the\n Claims Court was required to find his case frivolous before\n denying his motion, something which the Claims Court did\n not expressly do. 3\n      The Claims Court did not abuse its discretion in deny-\n ing Mr. Straw\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis.\n Courts have discretion to limit a party\u2019s permission to pro-\n ceed in forma pauperis where they have exhibited a history\n of frivolous or abusive filings. See, e.g., Martin v. D.C. Ct.\n of Appeals, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112790\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/112790\/martin-v-district-of-columbia-court-of-appeals\/\">506 U.S. 1<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1992) (denying a petitioner\u2019s re-\n quest to proceed in forma pauperis due to voluminous and\n abusive filing history); In re Sindram, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112515\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/112515\/in-re-sindram\/\">498 U.S. 177<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 180\n (1991) (\u201c[T]he Court has a duty to deny in forma pauperis\n status to those individuals who have abused the system.\u201d);\n In re McDonald, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112201\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/112201\/in-re-mcdonald\/\">489 U.S. 180<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 183\u201385 (1989) (denying pe-\n titioner\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and limiting\n petitioner\u2019s ability to proceed in forma pauperis in future\n petitions for extraordinary writs based on petitioner's\n abuse of judicial resources). A motion to proceed in forma\n pauperis should not be denied lightly. Denying an indigent\n party\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis may effectively\n cut off their access to the court. But, here, the Claims\n Court did not abuse its discretion.\n     Multiple courts, including this one, have found Mr.\n Straw\u2019s cases frivolous. See Straw, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 WL 2944400<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n\n\n       3  The Claims Court expressly found that Mr. Straw\u2019s\n \u201clitigation history of filing frivolous, repetitive, and vexa-\n tious actions weigh heavily against granting\u201d his motion to\n proceed in forma pauperis but never expressly identified\n the instant case as frivolous. 21-1602 App. at 21.\n\fCase: 21-1600    Document: 25     Page: 13    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n STRAW   v. US                                             13\n\n\n\n at *1. The Claims Court found that Mr. Straw has filed at\n least forty federal cases in the four years preceding its in-\n stitution of the Anti-Filing Order in January 2021.\n 21-<\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">1602 App. 1<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">. Included in those forty are four cases that\n Mr. Straw filed in the Claims Court over the course of two\n weeks in August and September of 2020. After granting\n the government\u2019s motions to dismiss in each of those four\n cases, the Claims Court instituted an Anti-Filing Order in\n case number 20-1157, one of the cases on appeal here. In\n that Order, the Claims Court found that Mr. Straw \u201chas\n repeatedly raised similar, frivolous claims in this Court\n and other federal courts,\u201d and that \u201ceach case reviewed has\n been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or as frivolous.\u201d\n 21-<\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">1602 App. 1<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">. This court has similarly found that Mr.\n Straw has filed \u201ca large number of meritless filings . . . in\n the Claims Court and other courts during the past several\n years.\u201d Straw, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 WL 2944400<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4. The Claims Court\n did not abuse its discretion to deny Mr. Straw\u2019s motion to\n proceed in forma pauperis considering his history of frivo-\n lous filing.\n     Mr. Straw argues that his motion to proceed in forma\n pauperis should have been granted due to his economic sta-\n tus. But a court is not constrained to only consideration of\n economic status in determining whether to grant a motion\n to proceed in forma pauperis. Section 1915 permits, but\n does not require, a court to allow a party to proceed without\n paying the requisite fees if \u201cthe person is unable to pay\n such fees or give security therefor.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1);\n see also Chamberlain, 655 F. App\u2019x at 825.\n     Mr. Straw also argues that the Claims Court must find\n the instant case frivolous, rather than rely on a history of\n frivolous filings, before it may deny a motion to proceed in\n forma pauperis. This is incorrect. The Claims Court is free\n to consider a history of frivolous filing in determining\n whether to grant a motion to proceed in forma pauperis.\n See, e.g., Martin, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112790\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/112790\/martin-v-district-of-columbia-court-of-appeals\/\">506 U.S. at 3<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\"> (denying motion to proceed\n in forma pauperis based on history of frivolous filing).\n\fCase: 21-1600    Document: 25      Page: 14    Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  14                                               STRAW   v. US\n\n\n\n Even if the Claims Court were required to consider the fri-\n volity of the complaint in this case, it could easily find the\n complaint frivolous on its face.          Mr. Straw seeks\n $12,000,000 in compensation for the Supreme Court\u2019s de-\n nial of twelve petitions for certiorari. As previously noted,\n the Claims Court has no jurisdiction to review decisions of\n the Supreme Court and, thus, no power to grant Mr. Straw\n the remedy he seeks.\n                      2. Anti-Filing Order\n      This court has previously abstained from deciding\n whether the imposition of the Anti-Filing Order was an\n abuse of discretion because the Order did not prevent filing\n of the case that was the subject of that prior appeal. Straw,\n <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 WL 2944400<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4. Although the Anti-Filing Order\n similarly did not prevent filing of either of the cases on ap-\n peal, the Claims Court entered the order as part of case\n number 20-1157, which is on appeal here in appeal number\n 21-1600. The Claims Court also incorporated its reasoning\n in the Anti-Filing Order as the basis of the denial of Mr.\n Straw\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis in case num-\n ber 21-745, also on appeal here in appeal number 21-1602.\n Thus, we address the imposition of the Anti-Filing Order\n on the merits here.\n      We find no abuse of discretion in the Claims Court\u2019s\n imposition of the Anti-Filing Order on the record before us\n for the same reasons discussed above with respect to the\n Claims Court\u2019s denial of Mr. Straw\u2019s motion to proceed in\n forma pauperis. Mr. Straw does not explain why the Anti-\n Filing Order is contrary to law, beyond baldly asserting\n that it is \u201ccontrary to law and the precedents of this Court.\u201d\n 21-1600 Appellant\u2019s Inf. Br. at 3. Thus, Mr. Straw has pro-\n vided no reason for this court to rescind the Anti-Filing Or-\n der.\n\fCase: 21-1600    Document: 25     Page: 15   Filed: 08\/06\/2021\n\n\n\n\n STRAW   v. US                                            15\n\n\n\n         3. Removal of the Presiding Claims Court Judge\n     In both of his appeals, Mr. Straw requests that this\n court remove the Claims Court judge who adjudicated his\n cases, alleging political bias. As this court found with re-\n spect to another of Mr. Straw\u2019s appeals raising the same\n allegations against the same Claims Court judge, this\n claim has no merit. Straw, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 WL 2944400<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3. The\n identity of the President who appointed a judge has no\n bearing on whether a judge should recuse themselves. <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">\n Mr. Straw\u2019s allegations against the Claims Court judge are\n unwarranted and personal. See <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at *1<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">. We note, moreo-\n ver, that, since we are affirming the Claims Court\u2019s dismis-\n sal in case number 20-1157, and not remanding anything\n to that court, there are no further matters to be addressed\n in that case. In the absence of Mr. Straw\u2019s payment of the\n required filing fee in case number 21-745, there may well\n be no further activities in that case as well.\n                       IV.    CONCLUSION\n     For the reasons above, we affirm the Claims Court\u2019s\n dismissal of case number 20-1157 for lack of jurisdiction.\n We affirm the Claims Court\u2019s denial of Mr. Straw\u2019s request\n to proceed in forma pauperis in case number 21-745 and\n remand that matter to the Claims Court for further pro-\n ceedings. For the same reasons, we affirm the Claims\n Court\u2019s imposition of an Anti-Filing Order in case number\n 20-1157. We reject Mr. Straw\u2019s request to remove the\n Claims Court judge that adjudicated these two cases.\n                        AFFIRMED\n                             COSTS\n No costs.\n\f<\/pre>",

(collectively, GSK) sued Teva Pharmaceuticals\n USA, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Dis-\n trict of Delaware for infringement of claims of GSK\u2019s Reis-\n sue Patent No. RE40,000. After the jury\u2019s verdict of\n infringement and its award of damages, the district court\n granted Teva\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as a matter\n of law of noninfringement.

This was because beta-blockers slow the heart rate\n and reduce the heart\u2019s ability to pump blood, a potentially\n deadly combination for patients with heart failure. Very\n few doctors or companies, therefore, saw the potential for\n investigating beta-blockers for treating CHF. Despite this\n skepticism, GSK spent years investigating, and conducting\n trials of, carvedilol for the treatment of heart failure. And\n at the time, the only known treatment for improving mor-\n tality rates in CHF patients was with angiotensin-convert-\n ing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Still, even with ACE\n inhibitors, patients continued to die from heart failure at\n high rates. It was not until the FDA approved GSK\u2019s\n Coreg\u00ae that using a beta-blocker to treat CHF became the\n standard of care for reducing mortality in heart failure pa-\n tients.\n     The carvedilol compound was patented in 1985. See\n U.S. Patent No. 4,503,067, expiration date March 5, 2007.\n In 1998, U.S. Patent No. 5,760,069 issued, which claimed a\n method of administering a combination of carvedilol and\n one or more of an ACE inhibitor, a diuretic, and digoxin to\n decrease mortality caused by CHF in a patient.\n      In March 2002, Teva filed an Abbreviated New Drug\n Application (ANDA) for FDA approval of its generic carve-\n dilol for all three indications. It certified, under Paragraph\n III of the Hatch-Waxman Act, 1 that it would not launch its\n product until the \u2019067 patent on the carvedilol compound\n expired      in    March      2007.

Teva also certified, under Para-\n graph IV, that the \u2019069 patent was \u201cinvalid, unenforceable,\n or not infringed.\u201d See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). On\n May 24, 2002, Teva sent GSK a Paragraph IV notice stat-\n ing that the claims of the \u2019069 patent are anticipated or\n would have been obvious. GSK did not sue Teva upon re-\n ceipt of the notice, and on November 25, 2003, GSK applied\n for reissue of the \u2019069 patent under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251. Teva\n received FDA \u201ctentative approval\u201d for its ANDA in 2004,\n \u201cfor treatment of heart failure and hypertension.\u201d\n J.A. 7437. The approval was to become effective when the\n \u2019067 patent expired in 2007.\n     On January 8, 2008, the PTO issued Reissue Patent\n No. RE40,000, and GSK notified the FDA on February 6,\n 2008. See J.A. 6880\u201382. The \u2019000 patent, asserted in this\n case, claims a method of decreasing mortality caused by\n CHF by administering carvedilol with at least one other\n therapeutic agent. See, e.g., \u2019000 patent, col. 1, ll. 17\u201325.\n Claim 1 recites:\n     1. A method of decreasing mortality caused by con-\n     gestive heart failure in a patient in need thereof\n     which comprises[:]\n     administering a therapeutically acceptable amount\n     of carvedilol in conjunction with one or more other\n     therapeutic agents, said agents being selected from\n     the group consisting of an angiotensin converting\n     enzyme inhibitor (ACE), a diuretic, and digoxin,\n     wherein the administering comprises administer-\n     ing to said patient daily maintenance dosages for a\n     maintenance period to decrease a risk of mortality\n     caused by congestive heart failure, and said mainte-\n     nance period is greater than six months.\n (emphasis in original).

J.A. 5532. In addition, the post-MI LVD\n and hypertension indications remained on the label. In re-\n sponse to the FDA\u2019s request for information regarding its\n position on the \u2019000 patent, Teva told the FDA it believed\n it need not \u201cprovide certification to [the \u2019000 patent]\u201d be-\n cause it received final approval of its ANDA before the \u2019000\n patent issued. J.A. 5554.\n     On July 3, 2014, GSK sued Teva and Glenmark Phar-\n maceuticals USA, the two largest suppliers of generic car-\n vedilol, in the District of Delaware, alleging that each had\n induced infringement of the \u2019000 patent. The action\n against Glenmark was severed and stayed.\n     During a seven-day jury trial, Teva argued the asserted\n claims of the \u2019000 patent were invalid and not infringed.\n Teva argued it could not have induced infringement, at\n least prior to 2011, because it had \u201ccarved out\u201d the indica-\n tion and prescribing information for treatment of conges-\n tive heart failure in its 2007 label under section viii. Teva\n also argued that it could not be liable for inducement for\n any time period because it did not cause others to infringe\n the method claimed in the \u2019000 patent.\n     The district court instructed the jury to assess whether\n Teva induced infringement during two distinct time peri-\n ods: the \u201cpartial label\u201d period and the \u201cfull label\u201d period.\n J.A. 171. The partial label period was from January 8,\n 2008, through April 30, 2011, when Teva\u2019s label had the\n post-MI LVD and hypertension indications but not the\n chronic heart failure indication. Id. The full label period\n was from May 1, 2011, through June 7, 2015, when Teva\u2019s\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187     Page: 9    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      9\n\n\n\n label had all three indications, including the chronic heart\n failure indication. Id.\n     The jury found the \u2019000 patent was not invalid, that\n Teva induced infringement of claims 1\u20133 during the partial\n label period, and that Teva induced infringement of claims\n 1\u20133 and 6\u20139 during the full label period. The jury assessed\n damages based on a combination of lost profits and a rea-\n sonable royalty and found Teva\u2019s infringement willful.\n     The district court granted Teva\u2019s renewed motion for\n JMOL, stating that substantial evidence did not support\n the verdict of induced infringement because GSK failed to\n prove that Teva\u2019s alleged inducement, as opposed to other\n factors, actually caused physicians to directly infringe by\n prescribing generic carvedilol for the treatment of mild to\n severe CHF. Dist. Ct. Op. at 591. The district court ex-\n plained that \u201c[w]ithout proof of causation, which is an es-\n sential element of GSK\u2019s action, a finding of inducement\n cannot stand.\u201d Id.\n     The district court also determined no reasonable juror\n could have found induced infringement based on the\n post-MI LVD indication in Teva\u2019s partial label, which GSK\n had argued instructed practice of the claimed method. Id.\n at 592 n.9. Although the district court acknowledged there\n is some overlap with CHF patients and post-MI LVD pa-\n tients, it reasoned \u201cthe two indications are distinct and re-\n quire different clinical testing and different FDA approvals\n to treat.\u201d Id. It further reasoned infringement required\n carvedilol be \u201cprescribed to treat the risk of mortality\n caused by CHF.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original). The district\n court concluded a reasonable juror could not have found\n Teva\u2019s post-MI LVD indication \u201ccaused or even encouraged\n direct infringement\u201d of this claimed use. Id.\n     GSK appealed, arguing that substantial evidence sup-\n ported the jury\u2019s finding of induced infringement and that\n its verdict should be reinstated. We agreed.

TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  requesting panel rehearing. Teva argued our October 2,\n  2020 decision could be broadly read to impose liability on\n  ANDA filers that carve out patented uses under section viii\n  when seeking approval to market generic drug products, in\n  direct contravention of the Hatch-Waxman Act. Amici cu-\n  riae raised concerns about lack of clarity of our decision\n  when the patented uses are carved out of the FDA-\n  approved label. On February 9, 2021, we granted the peti-\n  tion for panel rehearing, vacated the October 2, 2020 judg-\n  ment, and withdrew the October 2, 2020 opinions.\n       Amici were concerned that our prior decision could be\n  read to upset the careful balance struck with section viii\n  carve-outs. The Novartis Brief explained, \u201cGenerics could\n  be held liable for actively inducing infringement if they\n  marketed a drug with a label describing a patented thera-\n  peutic use or if they took active steps to encourage doctors\n  or patients to use the drug in an infringing manner. But\n  generics could not be held liable for merely marketing and\n  selling under a \u2018skinny\u2019 label omitting all patented indica-\n  tions, or for merely noting (without mentioning any infring-\n  ing uses) that FDA had rated a product as therapeutically\n  equivalent to a brand-name drug.\u201d Novartis Br. at 1\u20132. We\n  agree that Novartis accurately stated the law, and we\n  agreed to rehear this case to make clear how the facts of\n  this case place it clearly outside the boundaries of the con-\n  cerns expressed by amici. As this record reflects, in both\n  time periods, substantial evidence supports that Teva ac-\n  tively induced by marketing a drug with a label encourag-\n  ing a patented therapeutic use. They did not \u201comit[] all\n  patented indications\u201d or \u201cmerely note[] (without mention-\n  ing any infringing uses) that FDA had rated a product as\n  therapeutically equivalent to a brand-name drug.\u201d Novar-\n  tis Br. at 1\u20132. This is a case in which substantial evidence\n  supports a jury finding that the patented use was on the\n  generic label at all relevant times and that, therefore, Teva\n  failed to carve out all patented indications.

Throughout the\n  trial and on appeal, GSK argued there are two indications\n  on the labels that instruct doctors to prescribe carvedilol\n  for uses that directly infringe the \u2019000 patent claims: the\n  post-MI LVD indication and the congestive heart failure in-\n  dication. Thus, GSK argues both the partial label and the\n  full label encourage infringement.

GSK argues that substantial evidence sup-\n  ports the jury\u2019s verdict that Teva\u2019s partial label encouraged\n  an infringing use (via the post-MI LVD indication) and that\n  Teva\u2019s marketing materials encouraged prescribing carve-\n  dilol in a manner that would cause infringement of the \u2019000\n  patent.

The jury was entitled to credit expert testimony re-\n  garding the label\u2019s instructions on who should take what\n  drug, when, why, and how, and to reject the argument that\n  certain portions of the label were disjointed from others.\n      Teva relies on our decision in Bayer Schering Pharma\n  AG v. Lupin, Ltd., 676 F.3d 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2012). In Bayer\n  Schering, the patented method of use required achieving\n  three simultaneous effects in the body. Id. at 1320. The\n  defendant\u2019s drug product label contained an indication for\n  only one of those effects, with no discussion of safety or ef-\n  ficacy for the other two claimed effects. Id. at 1322. Thus,\n  we held the label failed to recommend or suggest achieving\n  the claimed combination of effects. Id. at 1324. Here, how-\n  ever, as discussed above, Dr. McCullough marched through\n  Teva\u2019s label explaining how it met the limitations of claim\n  1. Unlike the absence of information in the label of Bayer\n  Schering, Dr. McCullough provided testimony that Teva\u2019s\n  partial label instructed the claimed treatment and use.\n       Teva never genuinely challenged Dr. McCullough\u2019s tes-\n  timony regarding the contents of Teva\u2019s partial label. Teva\n  cites portions of Dr. Zusman\u2019s testimony as purporting to\n  contradict that the post-MI LVD indication means treating\n  heart failure. Teva relies on Dr. Zusman\u2019s testimony that\n  treating patients to help them survive heart attack is not\n  treating heart failure. Teva Principal and Resp. Br. at 53\n  (citing J.A. 11183). But Dr. Zusman also agreed the post-\n  MI LVD patients with symptomatic heart failure would be\n  diagnosed as suffering from congestive heart failure under\n  the district court\u2019s construction of that term (which has not\n  been appealed). J.A. 11226:14\u201319. It was within the prov-\n  ince of the jury to weigh the testimony presented by both\n  sides and make its finding. See Dardovitch v.

Cir. 2015) (\u201c[W]hen\n  there is conflicting testimony at trial, and the evidence\n  overall does not make only one finding on the point reason-\n  able, the jury is permitted to make credibility determina-\n  tions and believe the witness it considers more\n  trustworthy.\u201d).\n       We also do not agree with Teva\u2019s argument that its par-\n  tial label\u2019s recitation of treating patients \u201cwith or without\n  symptomatic heart failure\u201d precludes inducement since\n  this may encourage both infringing and noninfringing\n  uses. Teva relies on HZNP Medicines LLC v. Actavis La-\n  boratories UT, Inc., 940 F.3d 680 (Fed. Cir. 2019), and\n  Grunenthal GmbH v. Alkem Laboratories Ltd., 919 F.3d\n  1333 (Fed. Cir. 2019). According to Teva, when its generic\n  carvedilol is used to treat patients without symptomatic\n  heart failure, there is no infringement, and thus, the label\u2019s\n  recommended use on both types of patients somehow obvi-\n  ates infringement. We do not find this argument persua-\n  sive, and neither of the cases cited by Teva is analogous to\n  these facts.\n      In HZNP, the claimed method of use required three\n  steps: applying a topical medication, waiting for the\n  treated area to dry, and then applying a second topical\n  product. 940 F.3d at 702. Actavis\u2019 generic label, however,\n  only required the first applying step. The district court ex-\n  amined the label and held, at summary judgment, it did\n  not induce the claimed use. Id. We agreed given the lack\n  of evidence that the label encouraged, recommended, or\n  promoted users to perform two of the three claimed steps.\n  Id. In contrast, substantial evidence in this case supports\n  the jury\u2019s determination that Teva\u2019s partial label contained\n  information encouraging each claimed step and the pream-\n  ble. Dr. McCullough\u2019s testimony that the partial label met\n  each claim limitation and represented to doctors that the\n  treatment decreased mortality caused by CHF supports the\n  jury\u2019s finding. See J.A. 10623:6\u201317, 10629:19\u201310630:6,\n  10630:16\u201320.\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 18    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  18 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n       In Grunenthal, the claimed method of use was treating\n  polyneuropathic pain. 919 F.3d at 1336. The defendants\n  filed section viii statements carving out treatment of dia-\n  betic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), a type of polyneuro-\n  pathic pain. Id. at 1339. The generic labels nonetheless\n  maintained an indication to broadly treat severe pain re-\n  quiring around-the-clock treatment. Yet evidence sup-\n  ported that this severe pain would not necessarily be\n  polyneuropathic, but could also be mononeuropathic or no-\n  ciceptive. Id. In that case, the district court made a factual\n  determination that this label did not instruct the claimed\n  method. We found no clear error in the district court\u2019s find-\n  ing of no inducement because the generic labels did not\n  \u201cimplicitly or explicitly encourage or instruct users to take\n  action that would inevitably lead to . . . treatment of poly-\n  neuropathic pain.\u201d Id. at 1340. 3 Here, a jury found induce-\n  ment. The combination of Teva\u2019s partial label, Dr.\n  McCullough\u2019s element-by-element testimony that the par-\n  tial label explicitly instructs administering carvedilol for\n  the claimed use of decreasing mortality caused by CHF,\n  and Dr. Zusman\u2019s admission that the post-MI LVD indica-\n  tion falls within the definition of congestive heart failure is\n  substantial evidence that supports the jury\u2019s finding.\n      Critically, the district court erred by treating this fact\n  question\u2014whether the post-MI LVD indication instructs a\n  physician to prescribe carvedilol for a claimed use\u2014as\n  though it were a legal one for it to decide de novo. In a\n  footnote of the district court\u2019s JMOL decision, it decided the\n  post-MI LVD portion of Teva\u2019s label was insufficient to find\n  that the label instructed an infringing use. Dist.

The district court erred at JMOL by making a fact\n\n\n\n      3   Moreover, in contrast to this case, we recognized in\n  Grunenthal that the partial label was the only evidence of\n  inducement and that we could not conclude on those facts\n  that the district court clearly erred.\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187       Page: 19     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v.

Whether treat-\n  ing post-MI LVD patients with symptomatic heart failure\n  with carvedilol was within the scope of the claims was a\n  fact question. It was for the jury, not this court or the dis-\n  trict court, to resolve. \u201cIn determining whether the evi-\n  dence is sufficient to sustain [the jury\u2019s finding of] liability,\n  the court may not weigh the evidence, determine the cred-\n  ibility of witnesses, or substitute its version of the facts for\n  the jury\u2019s version.\u201d Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4\n  F.3d 1153, 1166 (3d Cir. 1993). The district court erred in\n  reweighing the evidence and finding against GSK following\n  the jury\u2019s verdict in its favor.\n                                 B\n       To be sure, the record was not devoid of contrary or\n  equivocal evidence. Teva argues that GSK\u2019s submissions\n  to the FDA for Orange Book listing associated with the \u2019000\n  patent is such evidence. If a new drug application (NDA)\n  has already been approved when the applicant obtains a\n  patent, the applicant must notify the FDA of such patent\n  within 30 days of it issuing. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.53(c)(2)(ii).\n  Under penalty of perjury, GSK submitted information for\n  the \u2019000 patent, which issued after carvedilol was FDA-\n  approved, declaring it claimed a method of use for carve-\n  dilol. J.A. 6880\u201387 (Form FDA 3542). GSK was required\n  in part 4.2a of its declaration to \u201cidentify the use with spe-\n  cific reference to the approved labeling for the drug prod-\n  uct.\u201d J.A. 6881. It listed: \u201ctreatment of mild-to-severe\n  heart failure of ischemic or cardiomyopathic origin, usually\n  in addition to diuretics, ACE inhibitor, and digitalis, to in-\n  crease survival.\u201d Id. GSK did not mention the post-MI\n  LVD indication in this submission to the FDA. This,\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 20     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  20 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  however, does not appear to be the information listed in the\n  Orange Book.\n      The FDA further required, in part 4.2b of the Form,\n  that GSK \u201c[s]ubmit the description of the approved indica-\n  tion or method of use that [it] propose[d] FDA include as\n  the \u2018Use Code\u2019 in the Orange Book.\u201d J.A. 6882. GSK an-\n  swered: \u201cDecreasing Mortality Caused By Congestive\n  Heart Failure.\u201d Id. The FDA accepted that representation\n  and listed the corresponding use code in the Orange Book\n  as describing what is covered by the \u2019000 patent.\n      There are two ways in which GSK\u2019s failure to identify\n  the post-MI LVD use in its part 4.2a statement could be\n  relevant to inducement in this case. First, that failure is\n  relevant to whether the post-MI LVD use infringes. Sec-\n  ond, at least for the partial label period, that failure is rel-\n  evant to intent to induce infringement. 4 On both points,\n  the jury decided against Teva.\n      As Teva acknowledged, GSK\u2019s submissions to the FDA\n  are \u201cnot absolutely dispositive of infringement.\u201d See Glax-\n  oSmithKline LLC v.

It\u2019s correct that FDA said the statement you just\n      had up there. I guess it\u2019s gone now, where FDA\n      provides a statement to that effect. That is correct.\n  Trial Tr. at 1057:13\u20131058:10. Both FDA experts agreed\n  that the FDA plays no role in determining patent infringe-\n  ment. The jury heard this evidence and the evidence dis-\n  cussed above as to GSK\u2019s claim that the post-MI LVD\n  indication infringed the \u2019000 patent. Thus, substantial ev-\n  idence supports the jury\u2019s finding that the post-MI LVD in-\n  dication infringed the \u2019000 patent.\n       At oral argument on rehearing, Teva suggested that\n  GSK\u2019s FDA submission for the Orange Book listing for the\n  \u2019000 patent, which according to Teva is at odds with GSK\u2019s\n  infringement allegations, creates equitable estoppel. See\n  Oral Arg. at 53:56\u201355:28. There are serious consequences\n  for filing false or incomplete information to the FDA. See\n  id. at 55:28\u201356:04 (Teva explaining the consequences in-\n  cluding rejection of the NDA); see also 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (it\n  is a criminal act to file a false declaration under penalty of\n  perjury). Teva argues one such consequence ought to be\n  equitable estoppel, which should preclude GSK\u2019s assertion\n  of the \u2019000 patent against Teva at least as to the post-MI\n  LVD use. GSK\u2019s representations regarding the Orange\n  Book listing of the \u2019000 patent, Teva\u2019s reliance, and fairness\n  go directly to an equitable estoppel defense, which has not\n  yet been tried to the district court. The district court\n  acknowledged that Teva raised this defense, but decided\n  that it was \u201creserved to be tried to the Court at a later\n  date.\u201d J.A. 29.\n       There are factual disputes regarding the estoppel issue\n  that the district court has not yet had an opportunity to\n  decide. For example, GSK argued on appeal that the use\n  code that was listed in the Orange Book\u2014\u201cdecreasing mor-\n  tality caused by congestive heart failure\u201d\u2014covers all heart\n  failure patients including post-MI LVD patients and that\n  Teva\u2019s assertion that the use code covers only the CHF\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 23     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      23\n\n\n\n  indication is wrong. GSK Resp. and Reply Br. at 30. GSK\n  further argues that \u201cthe use code is not tied to any partic-\n  ular indication, and the FDA tells generics that the use\n  code \u2018is not meant to substitute for the applicant\u2019s review\n  of the patent and the approved labeling.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting 68\n  Fed. Reg. at 36,683). And Dr. McCullough testified that\n  the post-MI LVD indication satisfied the first claim limita-\n  tion, i.e., decreasing mortality caused by congestive heart\n  failure. J.A. 10623:6\u201310623:23. It is also not clear from\n  this record whether Teva had access to GSK\u2019s declaration\n  (which was marked confidential and is not included in the\n  Orange Book). Teva responds that it modified the label ex-\n  actly as the FDA instructed it to in accordance with the\n  GSK-provided use code. See J.A. 6908\u201310 (FDA mark-up\n  of Teva label). As acknowledged above, Teva\u2019s own FDA\n  expert, Mr. Karst, explained that an ANDA filer must per-\n  form its own analysis for patent infringement purposes.\n  Trial Tr. at 1057:13\u20131058:10 (testimony of Mr. Karst). Is-\n  sues of fact remain as to GSK\u2019s representations and Teva\u2019s\n  reliance on those representations that have been \u201creserved\n  to be tried\u201d by the district court. J.A. 29.\n      The dissent proposes that this court leapfrog that nor-\n  mal process and resolve these questions of law, equity, and\n  fact on appeal without any trial. We decline to do so. The\n  dissent claims it is not focused on estoppel, but rather on\n  whether \u201cthe law\u201d permits an inference of intent from a la-\n  bel in light of GSK\u2019s representations to the FDA. See Dis.\n  at 19. The dissent would hold that GSK\u2019s representations\n  to the FDA in its declaration bar a finding of intent by the\n  jury as a matter of law regardless of the remainder of the\n  record. But intent is itself a question of fact, and this rec-\n  ord contained substantial evidence from which the jury\n  could find Teva intended to infringe despite GSK\u2019s repre-\n  sentation to the FDA. This rule of law the dissent seeks is\n  exactly the estoppel case made by Teva, which the district\n  court has yet to try.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 24    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  24 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n      The issues before us are the issues that were tried to\n  the jury and decided in the district court. We conclude sub-\n  stantial evidence supports the finding that Teva\u2019s partial\n  label was evidence Teva instructed physicians to use its\n  carvedilol in an infringing way. Dr. McCullough explained\n  where Teva\u2019s partial label met each claim limitation and\n  discussed other materials that would lead physicians to the\n  partial label, culminating with his conclusion that Teva\n  took action that it \u201cintended would encourage or assist ac-\n  tions by another, i.e., the physician.\u201d J.A. 10644:15\u201319.\n  Dr. McCullough did not testify that Teva\u2019s actions merely\n  describe infringement; he testified that Teva\u2019s actions en-\n  couraged infringement.\n      The dissent\u2019s suggestion that there were only three\n  pieces of evidence (the partial label plus the two press re-\n  leases) on which the jury could have relied to find intent is\n  equally inaccurate. The jury received Teva\u2019s partial label,\n  extensive expert testimony, Teva\u2019s product catalogs, Teva\u2019s\n  advertising and promotional activities, Teva\u2019s Monthly\n  Prescribing References for doctors, and testimony from\n  Teva\u2019s own company witnesses, all of which the jury could\n  have relied on to find Teva intended to encourage, recom-\n  mend, or promote infringement.\n      As the Supreme Court explained in Grokster:\n      Evidence of active steps taken to encourage direct\n      infringement such as advertising an infringing use\n      or instructing how to engage in an infringing use,\n      show an affirmative intent that the product be used\n      to infringe, and a showing that infringement was\n      encouraged overcomes the law\u2019s reluctance to find\n      liability when a defendant merely sells a commer-\n      cial product suitable for some lawful use.\n  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545\n  U.S. 913, 936 (2005) (citation and alterations omitted). In\n  this case, we must presume the jury found that Teva sold\n  carvedilol with a label that instructed physicians to use it\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 25     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      25\n\n\n\n  in an infringing manner. Our precedent has consistently\n  held that, when a product is sold with an infringing label\n  or an infringing instruction manual, such a label is evi-\n  dence of intent to induce infringement. See Vanda Pharm.\n  Inc. v. West-Ward Pharm. Int\u2019l Ltd., 887 F.3d 1117, 1130\u2013\n  31 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (no clear error in the district court\u2019s\n  finding that the label instructions constituted a recommen-\n  dation to infringe the claimed use); Sanofi v. Watson Labs.\n  Inc., 875 F.3d 636, 646 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (\u201cThe content of the\n  label in this case permits the inference of specific intent to\n  encourage the infringing use.\u201d); Eli Lilly and Co. v. Teva\n  Parenteral Med., Inc., 845 F.3d 1357, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2017)\n  (\u201cWhen the alleged inducement relies on a drug label\u2019s in-\n  structions, \u2018[t]he question is not just whether [those] in-\n  structions describ[e] the infringing mode, . . . but whether\n  the instructions teach an infringing use such that we are\n  willing to infer from those instructions an affirmative in-\n  tent to infringe the patent. The label must encourage, rec-\n  ommend, or promote infringement.\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted)\n  (quoting Takeda, 785 F.3d at 631); AstraZeneca, 633 F.3d\n  at 1060 (\u201cThe pertinent question is whether the proposed\n  label instructs users to perform the patented method. If so,\n  the proposed label may provide evidence of . . . affirmative\n  intent to induce infringement.\u201d); Arthrocare Corp. v. Smith\n  & Nephew, Inc., 406 F.3d 1365, 1377 (Fed.

The jury was en-\n  titled to credit expert testimony regarding the label\u2019s in-\n  structions on who should take what drug, when, why, and\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187     Page: 26    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  26 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n       We assume, as we must, that the jury found the post-\n  MI LVD use infringes the \u2019000 patent, and that Teva\u2019s label\n  contained instructions encouraging prescribing carvedilol\n  in a manner that infringes the \u2019000 patent. Throughout,\n  the dissent claims that there was not substantial evidence\n  upon which the jury could conclude that Teva\u2019s label would\n  encourage doctors to prescribe Teva\u2019s carvedilol for the la-\n  beled uses. That is because, according to Teva (and the dis-\n  sent), there is no evidence that doctors read labels or\n  prescribe according to those labels. But the jury was pre-\n  sented expert testimony from Dr. McCullough (GSK\u2019s ex-\n  pert), from Dr. Zusman (Teva\u2019s expert), and from Teva\u2019s\n  own documents to the contrary. First, Dr. McCullough tes-\n  tified that doctors do read labels. See J.A. 10612:7\u20139 (\u201cQ.\n  Two, that doctors don\u2019t read labels? Do you agree that that\n  is the case? A. No, I disagree with that.\u201d). Second, Teva\u2019s\n  own Monthly Prescribing References, which were \u201cin-\n  tended solely for use by the medical professional,\u201d ex-\n  plained that \u201c[t]he clinician must be familiar with the full\n  product labeling provided by the manufacturer or distribu-\n  tor of the drug, of every product he or she prescribes, as\n  well as the relevant medical literature.\u201d J.A. 6196 (Teva\u2019s\n  2012 Monthly Prescribing Reference); see also J.A.\n  10611:19\u201325 (Dr. McCullough); Trial Tr. at 1253:15\u201323,\n  1254:23\u20131255:9 (Dr. Zusman agreeing that Teva\u2019s MPR in-\n  dicates that the MPR \u201chas been produced to provide an eas-\n  ily accessible reminder of basic information useful to\n  review when prescribing medications\u201d and that physicians\n  should verify any questions against the labelling). In other\n  words, the literature Teva provided to doctors told them to\n  read labels and to prescribe according to them. While\n  Teva\u2019s Monthly Prescribing References were published\n  during the full label period, they powerfully refute Teva\u2019s\n  claim that doctors do not and need not read labels in\n\n\n  how, and to reject the dissent\u2019s claim that the label de-\n  scribes rather than instructs as to an infringing use.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 27     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      27\n\n\n\n  conjunction with their prescribing practices. Teva\u2019s own\n  Monthly Prescribing References merely confirm the quite\n  logical proposition that doctors read labels and that the la-\n  bels are intended to affect prescribing decisions. We cannot\n  conclude that it would be unreasonable for the jury to think\n  that, in 2007 or 2011, Teva believed doctors did not and\n  need not read labels and only then wisened to the idea in\n  2012. In fact, Teva\u2019s own Director of National Accounts,\n  Mr. Rekenthaler, testified to his belief that doctors would\n  prescribe carvedilol according to the package insert (the la-\n  bel). Trial Tr. at 590:15\u201317 (\u201cI guess my expectation is, like\n  any drug, that it would be used as detailed in the package\n  insert.\u201d); id. at 592:5\u20138 (\u201cI mean my assumption would be,\n  unless something specific was brought up, that it would be\n  used, that the physicians would use it as they should use\n  it, again which is detailed in our insert.\u201d).\n      This is record evidence that Teva intended its label to\n  affect physician\u2019s prescribing practices, and the jury was\n  entitled, as our caselaw has repeatedly held, to rely upon\n  that to determine Teva\u2019s intent. But it is not the only evi-\n  dence.\n      GSK also presented extensive expert testimony along\n  with Teva\u2019s marketing efforts, catalogs, press releases, and\n  testimony from Teva\u2019s own witnesses, showing that Teva\n  encouraged carvedilol sales for CHF despite its attempted\n  carve-out. This is evidence supporting the jury\u2019s finding\n  that Teva induced infringement.\n      The jury was presented with evidence of Teva\u2019s mar-\n  keting materials. Teva\u2019s Spring 2008 and Spring 2009\n  Product Catalogs described Teva\u2019s carvedilol as an\n  AB rated therapeutic equivalent to Coreg\u00ae. J.A. 6221,\n  6270. Teva and amici agree that an AB rating means the\n  generic product is therapeutically equivalent to the brand\n  product under the conditions specified in the generic\u2019s la-\n  bel. As explained above, substantial evidence supports the\n  jury\u2019s presumed conclusion that the partial label\u2019s\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 28    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  28 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  indication for post-MI LVD did not effectively carve out the\n  use claimed in the \u2019000 patent. Thus, Teva\u2019s AB rated rep-\n  resentations under these limited circumstances, when sub-\n  stantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s presumed\n  determination regarding the label\u2019s contents, are further\n  affirmative evidence supporting the jury\u2019s inducement\n  finding. 7\n      GSK also presented evidence that, prior to the \u2019000 pa-\n  tent\u2019s issuance, Teva issued two relevant press releases:\n  one in 2004 and another in 2007. In its 2004 press release,\n  Teva announced that the FDA granted it \u201ctentative ap-\n  proval\u201d for its carvedilol tablets, with final approval \u201cantic-\n  ipated upon expiry of patent protection for the brand\n  product on March 5, 2007.\u201d J.A. 6347. It noted its \u201cCarve-\n  dilol Tablets are the AB rated generic equivalent of Glax-\n  oSmithKline\u2019s Coreg\u00ae Tablets and are indicated for\n  treatment of heart failure and hypertension.\u201d Id. (emphasis\n  added). The dissent suggests that Teva\u2019s \u201creference to\n  heart failure\u201d is not evidence that supports the jury\u2019s find-\n  ing that Teva intended to encourage infringement of GSK\u2019s\n  claimed method. The entire purpose of this press release\n  is to announce its approval as a substitute for GSK\u2019s\n  Coreg\u00ae Tablets, and it expressly says that the Teva generic\n  \u201ctablets are the AB-rated generic equivalent of Glax-\n  oSmithKline\u2019s Coreg\u00ae Tablets and are indicated for treat-\n  ment of heart failure and hypertension.\u201d J.A. 6347. The\n  press release\u2019s use of \u201cheart failure\u201d does not parse between\n  congestive heart failure or post-MI LVD. This is not an\n\n\n\n      7    We do not hold that an AB rating in a true section\n  viii carve-out (one in which a label was produced that had\n  no infringing indications) would be evidence of inducement.\n  In this case, Teva\u2019s representation of AB rating would point\n  physicians to its partial label, which, for the reasons above,\n  the jury was free to credit as evidence of induced infringe-\n  ment.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 29     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      29\n\n\n\n  errant reference to \u201cheart failure\u201d; it is Teva in a press re-\n  lease telling the world that its generic is a substitute for\n  GSK\u2019s Coreg\u00ae tablets to treat congestive heart failure in\n  the same manner as Coreg\u00ae (which is a method that in-\n  fringed the \u2019000 patent). The dissent criticizes our analy-\n  sis, claiming that we have weakened intentional\n  encouragement because \u201csimply calling a product a \u2018generic\n  version\u2019 or \u2018generic equivalent\u2019\u2014is now enough.\u201d Dis. at\n  34\u201335. That is not our holding or the facts.\n      Though the dissent seems to think the press release is\n  not evidence of encouragement, it seems self-evident that a\n  jury could conclude that Teva\u2019s intent in issuing a press re-\n  lease telling the world it could use Teva\u2019s tablets as a sub-\n  stitute for GSK\u2019s Coreg\u00ae tablets to treat congestive heart\n  failure was to encourage that use.            Moreover, Dr.\n  McCullough testified that he saw the 2004 press release\n  and that it indicates physicians should prescribe generic\n  carvedilol for heart failure. J.A. 11656:1\u201310; J.A. 11657:6\u2013\n  10 (testifying that Teva\u2019s press release informed doctors\n  that \u201cit certainly should be\u201d prescribed for the treatment of\n  heart failure); J.A. 11659:11\u201319 (Teva\u2019s press release indi-\n  cates that doctors should be able to prescribe generic car-\n  vedilol for heart failure). Dr. McCullough also testified\n  that doctors consider press releases so they \u201cknow when\n  drugs are going generic.\u201d J.A. 11655:9\u201324.\n      Teva issued a second press release in 2007 in which it\n  stated that it had received final approval \u201cto market its Ge-\n  neric version of GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s cardiovascular agent\n  Coreg\u00ae (Carvedilol) Tablets.\u201d J.A. 6353. Dr. McCullough\n  testified that the 2007 press release\u2019s use of \u201ccardiovascu-\n  lar agent\u201d indicated to doctors they could use Teva\u2019s carve-\n  dilol \u201cfor all indications,\u201d including heart failure. J.A.\n  11660:3\u201313. Dr. McCullough also testified that he believed\n  that this press release would encourage doctors to pre-\n  scribe Teva\u2019s generic carvedilol for the infringing indica-\n  tions. J.A. 10644:15\u201319 (\u201cQ. And so this element that Teva\n  took action and failed to take action, what Teva intended\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 30     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  30 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  would encourage or assist actions by another party, i.e., the\n  physician. In your expert opinion, has that requirement\n  been met? A. Yes.\u201d (emphasis added)) (Dr. McCullough dis-\n  cussing the impact of the press releases on doctors). On\n  appeal, we review the jury\u2019s verdict for substantial evi-\n  dence based upon the record; we cannot hunt outside the\n  record to find evidence to try to contradict the verdict. The\n  dissent claims there is no intentional encouragement be-\n  cause the word cardiovascular is \u201c[a] well-understood ad-\n  jective\u201d that means \u201crelating to the heart,\u201d and as such\n  Teva\u2019s press release could simply be read to encourage use\n  for non-patented heart related conditions. Dis. at 23.\n  First, the dissent goes outside the record to make up this\n  definition, something the district court explicitly told the\n  jury it could not do. See Trial Tr. at 264 (\u201cDuring the course\n  of the trial, you must not conduct any independent re-\n  search about the case . . . . In other words, you should not\n  consult dictionaries or reference materials.\u201d). Second,\n  there was actual testimony in the record about how the\n  word cardiovascular in this press release would be under-\n  stood by skilled artisans. See J.A. 11660:3\u201313 (McCullough\n  testifying that a skilled artisan would understand the word\n  cardiovascular in this press release to indicate that the ge-\n  neric could be used for all indications including heart fail-\n  ure). Third, Teva did not merely say its drug is a\n  cardiovascular agent, leaving the world to wonder about its\n  uses. It said its product is a generic equivalent of GSK\u2019s\n  cardiovascular agent Coreg\u00ae. It was reasonable for the jury\n  to conclude, especially in light of the prior press release\n  that expressly mentioned heart failure, that Teva was\n  again encouraging the substitution of its product for all of\n  Coreg\u2019s\u00ae cardiovascular indications, including as claimed\n  in the \u2019000 patent.\n      We have acknowledged that, as a matter of law, affirm-\n  ative acts taken before a patent issues cannot violate\n  \u00a7 271(b). Nat\u2019l Presto Indus., Inc. v. W. Bend Co., 76 F.3d\n  1185, 1196 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.       31\n\n\n\n  jury was instructed GSK needed to prove by a preponder-\n  ance of the evidence:\n      that Teva took some affirmative action, or that\n      Teva continued to take an action that began before\n      the \u2019000 patent issued, after the \u2019000 patent was is-\n      sued on January 8, 2008, intending to cause the\n      physicians to directly infringe by administering\n      Teva\u2019s carvedilol product[.]\n  J.A. 168. In this case, the jury was presented with evidence\n  from which it could infer that Teva\u2019s press releases re-\n  mained on Teva\u2019s website until at least 2015. J.A. 6353\n  (2007 press release date stamped \u201c4\/14\/2015\u201d). Teva\u2019s Di-\n  rector of Marketing testified that Teva added carvedilol\n  product information to the Teva website as part of its 2007\n  launch. J.A. 10991:13\u201322 (Suzanne Collier, Teva\u2019s Direc-\n  tor of Marketing Communications and Trade Dress). The\n  2007 press release given to the jury contains a directory\n  path showing it was stored on the Teva website as follows:\n  \u201cHome page>Media>Latest News.\u201d And GSK demon-\n  strated the 2007 Teva press release was available on the\n  Teva website as late as 2015. The press releases were ex-\n  tensively and repeatedly presented before the jury, with at\n  least five witnesses discussing them. See J.A. 10643:2\u2013\n  10644:14, 11656:4\u201311657:5, 11659:11\u201311660:17 (discussed\n  with Dr. McCullough); J.A. 11238:10\u201311241:14, Trial Tr. at\n  1241:15\u20131243:5 (discussed with Dr. Zusman); J.A.\n  10533:16\u201323, 10542:1\u201325 (discussed with Prof. Lietzan);\n  Trial Tr. at 445:9\u2013447:10, J.A. 10973:15\u201310974:23, Trial\n  Tr. at 974:24\u2013975:4 (discussed with Teva\u2019s Senior Director\n  of Regulatory Affairs, Jill Pastore); Trial Tr. at 1619:9\u201318\n  (discussed with Teva\u2019s damages expert, Dr. Sumanth Ad-\n  danki). Teva neither provided contrary evidence nor ar-\n  gued to the jury that the press releases, at least one of\n  which could be found on the Teva website even at the time\n  of trial, were not available on Teva\u2019s website throughout\n  the alleged infringement period. Under these circum-\n  stances, the jury could infer, from Teva\u2019s placement of\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 32     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  32 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v.

Substantial evidence sup-\n  ports the jury\u2019s verdict that Teva induced infringement.\n                                C\n      GSK presented evidence that Teva\u2019s partial label did\n  not successfully carve out the patented use, and thus, Teva\n  was selling its generic with a label which infringed the\n  method claim. GSK presented evidence that doctors read\n  and consider labels, that Teva\u2019s marketing materials\n  guided doctors to the label and to its website promoting the\n  patented use, that Teva issued press releases encouraging\n  doctors to prescribe carvedilol for the patented use, that\n  Teva\u2019s own employees expected doctors to prescribe carve-\n  dilol during the partial label period for the patented uses,\n  and expert testimony that Teva\u2019s actions encouraged doc-\n  tors to do so. This is substantial evidence from which a\n  reasonable jury could conclude that Teva intentionally en-\n  couraged the practice of the claimed method. Accordingly,\n\n\n\n      8   The jury was even presented evidence that Teva\n  encouraged doctors to visit its website for information\n  about its generic drugs when prescribing them.

The dissent confronts none of this\n  evidence. To be clear, the dissent would overturn a jury\n  verdict, finding Teva\u2019s full label encouraged doctors to pre-\n  scribe an infringing manner, as not supported by substan-\n  tial evidence where the label undisputedly encourages an\n  infringing uses (CHF) and when Teva tells doctors to read\n  its label for prescribing information.

For example, the use of ge-\n  neric carvedilol supplied by companies other than Teva\n  was not an acceptable non-infringing substitute.\u201d J.A. 195\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 39     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      39\n\n\n\n  (Jury Instruction 6.3.3). Teva argues that this instruction\n  ignores the reality of the marketplace because other carve-\n  dilol producers who had not been sued for infringement\n  would have made the sales Teva made, in part because\n  pharmacies would automatically substitute generic carve-\n  dilol for Coreg\u00ae prescriptions. Teva\u2019s argument is in con-\n  flict with long-standing precedent that the presence of\n  noninfringing alternatives precludes an award of lost prof-\n  its, but the presence of other infringers does not.\n      The district court correctly instructed the jury that the\n  availability of carvedilol from other generic producers is\n  not a \u201cnon-infringing substitute.\u201d GSK\u2019s expert\u2019s analysis\n  accounted for Teva\u2019s sales for the infringing use, amount-\n  ing to 17.1% of Teva\u2019s total carvedilol sales. Had another\n  generic producer made those sales, those uses too would\n  have been infringing. The other generic carvedilol produc-\n  ers were, therefore, not noninfringing alternatives.

At the\n  time, however, it still had a patent on one of carvedilol\u2019s\n  three FDA-approved uses. Because the FDA cannot au-\n  thorize a generic version of a drug that would infringe a\n  patent, this one remaining patented use could have pre-\n  vented a less-expensive, generic carvedilol from coming to\n  market altogether\u2014even though the drug itself and other\n  uses of it were unpatented. Congress saw this problem\n  coming. It wanted to make sure that one patented use\n  wouldn\u2019t prevent public access to a generic version of a\n  drug that also has unpatented uses. See Caraco Pharm.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 42     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  2   GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n\n  Labs. Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A\/S, 566 U.S. 399, 415 (2012).\n  So it created rules for just this situation.\n       These rules, embodied in the so-called skinny-label pro-\n  visions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, are straightforward. If\n  a brand drug company (here, GSK) has a patent on one of\n  a drug\u2019s uses, it tells the FDA which use is patented. In\n  fact, it tells the FDA exactly what language from its label\n  is covered by its patents. The FDA will then permit a ge-\n  neric version of that drug to come to market if the manu-\n  facturer \u201ccarves out\u201d such use from its drug label by\n  omitting the language that the brand drug company iden-\n  tified. That\u2019s what happened here. GSK\u2019s sworn FDA fil-\n  ings identified just one use as patented. So Teva carved\n  out that use and came to market with its \u201cskinny\u201d label. It\n  played by the rules, exactly as Congress intended. It sold\n  its generic for years without controversy.\n       And then, in the seventh year, GSK finally sued. It al-\n  leged that, even though Teva\u2019s skinny label carved out the\n  very use\u2014indeed, the only use\u2014that GSK said was pa-\n  tented, the label showed that Teva intended to encourage\n  an infringing use. GSK also supported its inducement case\n  by pointing to two cursory, pre-patent press releases that\n  announced Teva\u2019s drug\u2019s approval (or \u201ctentative\u201d approval)\n  and called it the generic equivalent of GSK\u2019s brand drug\n  Coreg. The evidence of inducement\u2014i.e., that Teva had\n  culpable intent to encourage infringement and that its\n  skinny label or press releases caused doctors\u2019 prescribing\n  practices\u2014was thin to nonexistent. But a jury found Teva\n  liable all the same. This sometimes happens. And when it\n  does, there is a remedy: a court will reverse a jury\u2019s verdict\n  if there is insufficient evidence to support it. The experi-\n  enced trial judge sensibly did just that.\n       The majority, now on its second try, again reinstates\n  the verdict nonetheless. Its first try prompted widespread\n  criticism concerning the troubling implications for skinny\n  labels. This effort is no better. With reasoning sometimes\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 43    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.        3\n\n\n\n  labored, sometimes opaque, the majority strains to prop up\n  a jury verdict that is unsupportable. For example, based\n  on language that remained on the skinny label after Teva\u2019s\n  carve-out, the majority finds it reasonable to infer that\n  Teva intentionally encouraged infringement. It finds this\n  reasonable even though Teva, by carving out everything\n  that GSK said would infringe, was trying to avoid having\n  its label encourage infringement. The majority then in-\n  dulges the inference that doctors, as a class, relied on\n  Teva\u2019s skinny label to infringe, even though every expert\n  cardiologist at trial said he didn\u2019t even read the label to\n  make prescribing decisions. And, most troubling, the ma-\n  jority is willing to see culpable intent behind a generic\u2019s de-\n  scribing its product as the \u201cequivalent\u201d of a brand drug\u2014in\n  a system that requires generic drugs to be equivalent, and\n  in which everyone understands that generic drugs are\n  equivalent.\n       I write in this case because far from being a disagree-\n  ment among reasonable minds about the individual facts,\n  this case signals that our law on this issue has gone awry.\n  I am particularly concerned with three aspects of the ma-\n  jority\u2019s analysis. First, even setting aside the majority\u2019s\n  willingness to glean intentional encouragement from a la-\n  bel specifically designed to avoid encouragement, the ma-\n  jority further weakens the intentional-encouragement\n  prong of inducement by effectively eliminating the demar-\n  cation between describing an infringing use and encourag-\n  ing that use in a label. Second, the majority defies basic\n  tort law by eviscerating the causation prong of inducement.\n  The upshot of these two moves is that a plaintiff now has\n  to show very little for a jury to speculate as to the rest.\n  Third, the majority creates confusion for generics, leaving\n  them in the dark about what might expose them to liabil-\n  ity. These missteps throw a wrench into Congress\u2019s design\n  for enabling quick public access to generic versions of un-\n  patented drugs with unpatented uses.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 44     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  4   GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v.

The process begins when a brand\n  manufacturer submits a new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d).\n  The NDA must include a proposed label describing the spe-\n  cific uses\u2014called indications\u2014for the drug. Id. at 404; see\n  21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b)(1); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.50(a)(1), (e)(2)(ii).\n  See generally 21 C.F.R. pt. 201.\n       Once the FDA has approved a brand drug, another\n  company may seek permission to market a generic version\n  by filing an abbreviated new drug application (\u201cANDA\u201d).\n  Because the Act is designed to minimize the barriers to en-\n  try for generic drugs, the generic doesn\u2019t have to rehash the\n  brand\u2019s safety-and-efficacy trials. It must, however, show\n  that what it manufactures is bioequivalent to the brand\n  drug. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(iv), (j)(4)(F); 21 C.F.R.\n  \u00a7 314.94(a)(7)(i). 4 And the generic\u2019s proposed labeling\n  must essentially copy the brand drug\u2019s label.

TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n\n      Often a generic wants to launch while patents remain\n  on a drug or its uses. Anticipating this, Congress provided\n  two pathways for generics to show that a proposed label\n  will not infringe.\n       The first pathway is to file a certification explaining\n  why the generic label will not infringe any patent that a\n  brand has identified to the FDA as covering the drug. The\n  commonly used \u201cparagraph IV\u201d certification states that a\n  generic label will not infringe because the patent \u201cis invalid\n  or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of\n  the [generic] drug.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). Para-\n  graph IV often prompts litigation. If a generic, armed with\n  a good-faith paragraph IV argument, files an ANDA with a\n  brand\u2019s full label, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows the brand\n  to sue and entitles it to an automatic 30-month stay of final\n  FDA approval of the generic drug while the underlying pa-\n  tent issues are worked out in court. See 35 U.S.C.\n  \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iii); Eli Lilly,\n  496 U.S. at 670\u201371, 676. This first pathway, then, has par-\n  ties sort things out up front if infringement or validity are\n  in legitimate dispute.\n       The second pathway\u2014and the one relevant here\u2014is\n  available if at least one brand-labeled use is unpatented. If\n  that\u2019s so, the generic can just \u201ccarve out\u201d the patented uses\n  from its label. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(viii) (\u201csection\n  viii\u201d); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.94(a)(8)(iv); Caraco, 566 U.S.\n  at 404\u201307; Takeda, 785 F.3d at 630 (\u201cCongress intended\n  that a single drug could have more than one indication and\n  yet that an ANDA applicant could seek approval for less\n  than all of those indications.\u201d (cleaned up)). The result, an\n  exception to \u201cthe usual rule that a generic drug must bear\n  the same label\u201d as the brand, Caraco, 566 U.S. at 406, is\n  commonly called a \u201cskinny\u201d or \u201cpartial\u201d or \u201ccarve-out\u201d label.\n      Because the skinny-label pathway\u2019s availability de-\n  pends on at least one brand-labeled use being unpatented,\n  the FDA needs to know whether any labeled uses are\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 47    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      7\n\n\n\n  unpatented\u2014and which. More pragmatically, because the\n  FDA \u201ccannot authorize a generic drug that would infringe\n  a patent,\u201d Caraco, 566 U.S. at 405, it needs assurance that\n  a generic\u2019s skinny label has carved out the patented brand-\n  labeled uses, leaving behind only unpatented ones. But be-\n  cause the FDA is not an arbiter of patent issues, 5 how can\n  it know whether the skinny-label pathway is available and\n  whether it can approve a given label?\n       The solution that worked\u2014before today, at least\u2014was\n  for the FDA and generics to rely on what brands say their\n  patents cover. See Caraco, 566 U.S. at 407 (\u201c[W]hether sec-\n  tion viii is available to a generic manufacturer depends on\n  how the brand describes its patent.\u201d); see also 21 U.S.C.\n  \u00a7 355(b), (c) (requiring submission of patent information\n  with NDA). In particular, a brand submits under penalty\n  of perjury a declaration identifying \u201ceach pending method\n  of use or related indication and related patent claim\u201d and\n  \u201cthe specific section of the proposed labeling for the drug\n  product that corresponds to the method of use claimed by\n  the patent submitted.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.53(c)(2)(O) (2008). 6\n  This declaration also contains a brand-crafted, 240-charac-\n  ter \u201cuse code.\u201d 7 68 Fed.

By 2007, the compound itself was no longer pa-\n  tented, nor were most uses of it.\n      Carvedilol is a beta blocker, a class of drugs used since\n  the 1960s to treat heart conditions. Carvedilol in particu-\n  lar was developed in the 1980s and was covered by U.S.\n  Patent No. 4,503,067, which issued in 1985 and claimed\n  the compound itself.\n      By the early 1990s, research from various groups re-\n  vealed that beta blockers could be useful for treating a con-\n  dition called congestive heart failure (\u201cCHF\u201d), which\n  prevents the heart from being able to deliver enough oxy-\n  genated blood to the body. By 1995, GSK had already re-\n  ceived approval for an NDA under the brand name Coreg\n  for hypertension. A supplement to that NDA added the\n  CHF indication to the label in 1997. After the approval of\n  the CHF labeling, GSK received U.S. Patent No. 5,760,069,\n  relating to a particular manner of using carvedilol with\n  other drugs to treat CHF.

TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  \u2019067 patents in the Orange Book. Eventually, and well be-\n  fore any generic launched, carvedilol became the standard\n  of care for CHF. This standard was incorporated into the\n  official guidelines of the American College of Cardiology\n  and American Heart Association (as well as numerous\n  medical textbooks and journals) and taught to medical stu-\n  dents around the country.\n       As the 2007 expiration of GSK\u2019s carvedilol compound\n  patent approached, interest grew among generics. Upon\n  this expiration, generics would be able to market carvedilol\n  in one of two ways: either with an all-indications label (by\n  challenging GSK\u2019s method patent under a paragraph IV\n  certification) or by simply omitting any patented uses from\n  the label (with a section viii statement). Teva first chose\n  the former, reasoning\u2014correctly, as it turned out\u2014that\n  GSK\u2019s \u2019069 method patent was invalid. And so in mid-2002\n  Teva filed its ANDA with a proposed full label directed to\n  hypertension and CHF, certifying that it would wait for\n  GSK\u2019s compound patent to expire but that GSK\u2019s\n  \u2019069 method patent was invalid. J.A. 3003\u201319, 5463. GSK\n  did not sue or seek to block Teva\u2019s approval. Instead it\n  sought reissue of its \u2019069 patent, admitting invalidity of the\n  original and adding narrowing limitations to overcome va-\n  lidity challenges.\n       In 2003, GSK got approval to add another indication to\n  its label: post-MI LVD. 10 This entailed a discrete new set\n  of label text, with new underlying clinical studies and new\n  instructions. Teva likewise updated the label accompany-\n  ing its pending ANDA to include all three indications. In\n  2004, the FDA determined that Teva had shown its product\n\n\n\n      10  This condition concerns patients who have recently\n  suffered a heart attack (a \u201cmyocardial infarction,\u201d or \u201cMI\u201d)\n  and whose hearts have trouble pumping blood (\u201cleft ven-\n  tricular dysfunction,\u201d or \u201cLVD\u201d).\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187     Page: 51    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v.

So Teva did too,\n  informing the FDA that it now intended to carve out from\n  GSK\u2019s label the uses GSK said were patented.\n       Again, GSK\u2019s label contained three sets of instructions\n  for three distinct indications: CHF, post-MI LVD, and hy-\n  pertension:\n\n\n\n\n  J.A. 7992. And according to GSK\u2019s sworn declaration to the\n  FDA (which appropriately tracked the label\u2019s language),\n  only one of these three was patented\u2014CHF:\n\n\n\n\n  J.A. 6895. Faithful to GSK\u2019s declaration, the FDA for-\n  warded Teva a redlined label for use that omitted every-\n  thing GSK had said the \u2019069 method patent covered:\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 52    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  12 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n\n  J.A. 6913. It instructed Teva to use that label, which Teva\n  did\u2014with the same carve-out as the other seven generic\n  manufacturers that launched at that time.\n      After the generics launched, GSK\u2019s \u2019069 method patent\n  reissued as U.S. Patent No. RE40,000, the patent relevant\n  here. GSK added several narrowing limitations to the\n  \u2019000 patent to save it from invalidity. With the reissue pro-\n  cess now completed, GSK delisted its \u2019069 method patent\n  from the Orange Book and listed the \u2019000 patent in its\n  stead\u2014again submitting a sworn declaration identifying\n  only the CHF indication as covered. J.A. 6880\u201387. Con-\n  sistent with this representation, GSK did not sue the ge-\n  nerics, whose skinny labels included everything but CHF.\n      Years later in 2011, the FDA directed Teva to revise its\n  label to include the CHF indication. Teva complied. The\n  skinny-label period thus ended and the full-label period be-\n  gan. Teva did not issue a press release or otherwise notify\n  doctors of the change to its label. Indeed, Teva did not\n  change anything about how it marketed its generic\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 53    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v.

This Litigation\n      GSK did not sue in 2004 when Teva made its full-label\n  paragraph IV certification. Nor in 2007 when Teva\n  launched its skinny-label generic. Nor in 2008 when GSK\u2019s\n  \u2019000 patent emerged from reissue. Nor even in 2011 when\n  Teva transitioned to the full label. It sued instead in 2014,\n  just before the \u2019000 patent expired.\n      The lawsuit ultimately led to a seven-day jury trial in\n  2018. The jury was asked to determine whether Teva in-\n  duced infringement of the \u2019000 patent based on the skinny-\n  label period and the full-label period separately. It found\n  that Teva induced infringement of the \u2019000 patent based on\n  both labels. It also found that GSK was entitled to\n  $234.1 million in lost profits and $1.4 million in reasona-\n  ble-royalty damages.\n       After the verdict, Teva filed a renewed motion for\n  JMOL, arguing that GSK had not presented legally suffi-\n  cient evidence to support a finding of inducement. The dis-\n  trict court agreed and granted Teva\u2019s motion.          See\n  GlaxoSmithKline LLC v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 313 F.\n  Supp. 3d 582 (D. Del. 2018). GSK appealed, and Teva\n  cross-appealed as to damages.\n      The case was argued to us in September 2019. In Oc-\n  tober 2020, the majority issued a first opinion reversing the\n  district court\u2019s JMOL. That opinion prompted widespread\n  consternation and confusion, as described in Teva\u2019s peti-\n  tion for rehearing and the eight amicus briefs in support.\n  Among these amici: both generics and brands, fifty-seven\n  law professors, and Congressman Waxman.

The majority now issues a second\n  opinion reaching the same result as before, but with new\n  reasoning. In particular, it now declares that this is not a\n  \u201ctrue\u201d skinny-label case. E.g., Maj. 10\u201311, 28 n.7. But this\n  remains a skinny-label case, the record remains the record,\n  and inducement liability remains unsupportable.\n                         II. DISCUSSION\n      Although the JMOL standard is well settled, two points\n  bear emphasizing. First, while we give the verdict winner\n  the benefit of \u201cevery favorable and reasonable inference,\u201d\n  Dun & Bradstreet Software Servs., Inc. v. Grace Consult-\n  ing, Inc., 307 F.3d 197, 205 (3d Cir. 2002), the operative\n  word here is \u201creasonable.\u201d Indeed, \u201conly all reasonable\u201d in-\n  ferences need be drawn in GSK\u2019s favor, not \u201call possible in-\n  ferences.\u201d See Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., 281 F.3d\n  1054, 1065 n.10 (9th Cir. 2002). Second, if too many infer-\n  ences must be strung together to support the verdict, the\n  verdict is likely unsupportable. See Roebuck v. Drexel\n  Univ., 852 F.2d 715, 736 (3d Cir. 1988) (\u201cAlthough we be-\n  lieve that each of the inferences that we have discussed [is]\n  individually logically sound, we recognize that at some\n  point too many inferences become[s] mere specula-\n  tion . . . .\u201d); cf. United States v. Weber, 923 F.2d 1338, 1345\n  (9th Cir. 1990) (\u201cEach of these inferences standing alone\n  may be reasonable. But with each succeeding inference,\n  the last reached is less and less likely to be true.\u201d).\n      As to induced infringement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(b),\n  GSK bore the burden at trial to prove two things relevant\n  here. First, GSK had to prove that, more likely than not,\n  Teva engaged in \u201cculpable conduct, directed to encouraging\n  another\u2019s infringement.\u201d DSU Med. Corp. v. JMS Co.,\n  471 F.3d 1293, 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (en banc in relevant\n  part); see Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v.

TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      15\n\n\n\n  premises liability on purposeful, culpable expression and\n  conduct . . . .\u201d). In other words, not only must Teva have\n  \u201cpossessed specific intent to encourage another\u2019s infringe-\n  ment,\u201d DSU, 471 F.3d at 1306, it must have taken \u201caffirm-\n  ative steps to bring about [that] desired result,\u201d Global-\n  Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A., 563 U.S. 754, 760 (2011).\n       Second, GSK had to prove that, more likely than not,\n  Teva\u2019s affirmative steps actually caused the infringement\n  it wanted to bring about. DSU, 471 F.3d at 1304 (plaintiff\n  must show that \u201cthe alleged infringer\u2019s actions induced in-\n  fringing acts\u201d); see Grokster, 545 U.S. at 936\u201337 (when de-\n  fendant takes \u201caffirmative steps\u201d to \u201cfoster infringement,\n  [it] is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third\n  parties\u201d (emphasis added)); Sanofi v.

Cir. 2017) (noting the \u201cpurposeful-\n  causation connotation\u201d of the Supreme Court\u2019s characteri-\n  zation of inducement).\n      The discussion that follows has three parts. Part A ad-\n  dresses the lack of inducement during the skinny-label pe-\n  riod, as well as the flaws in the majority\u2019s analysis. Part B\n  does the same for the full-label period. Part C addresses\n  more broadly why the majority\u2019s analysis has troubling im-\n  plications for skinny labels and inducement law generally.\n                  A. The Skinny-Label Period\n       For the skinny-label period\u2014that is, from Teva\u2019s\n  skinny-label launch in 2007 to its full-label amendment in\n  2011\u2014the majority relies on three key pieces of evidence to\n  conclude that substantial evidence supports the verdict:\n  the skinny label itself (in particular, the post-MI LVD in-\n  dication on that label) and two press releases distributed\n  before the \u2019000 patent issued\u2014one from 2007, another from\n  2004. I discuss each in turn, followed by the majority\u2019s sup-\n  posedly substantial other evidence of intent. From them,\n  alone or combined, no reasonable jury could have found\n  (1) culpable intent to encourage infringement or (2) causa-\n  tion, much less both.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 56    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  16 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n                  1. The Skinny Label Itself\n      Before discussing what the skinny label said, recall\n  what it didn\u2019t say\u2014and why. The label omitted the CHF\n  indication (and only the CHF indication) because GSK\u2019s\n  sworn FDA filings asserted patent coverage of the CHF in-\n  dication (and only the CHF indication). Analogizing to a\n  typical patent case, it\u2019s as though Teva had drafted a po-\n  tentially infringing user manual and then, abiding by the\n  patentee\u2019s clear guidance, deleted all the pages that might\n  be viewed as encouraging infringement of a patented\n  method. Ironically, everything about this process signals\n  that, far from intending to encourage infringement, Teva\n  very much intended not to encourage infringement with its\n  skinny label.\n      Of course, this will likely be true of most generics that\n  get approved via the Hatch-Waxman section viii skinny-la-\n  bel pathway. Indeed, inferring intentional encouragement\n  to infringe a method\u2014from a label that has intentionally\n  omitted everything that the brand said covers that\n  method\u2014is a lot to ask of a reasonable factfinder. Only\n  once has this court upheld an inducement finding involving\n  a putative skinny label, and that case had a crucial, addi-\n  tional fact: the generic knew it had an infringement prob-\n  lem. AstraZeneca LP v. Apotex, Inc., 633 F.3d 1042, 1060\n  (Fed. Cir. 2010); see Grunenthal GmbH v. Alkem Labs.\n  Ltd., 919 F.3d 1333, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\u201c[AstraZeneca]\n  held that specific intent could be inferred because the de-\n  fendant proceeded with a plan to distribute the generic\n  drug knowing that its label posed infringement prob-\n  lems.\u201d). By contrast, GSK put on no similar evidence here.\n  Indeed, the facts surrounding Teva\u2019s skinny label are sim-\n  ple and undisputed.\n      The majority nonetheless manufactures a factual dis-\n  pute, all on its own. It surmises that: maybe, just maybe,\n  GSK\u2019s declarations were confidential, hidden from Teva\u2019s\n  view\u2014the implication being that Teva couldn\u2019t have relied\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 57    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.     17\n\n\n\n  on them. 11 Maj. 23. Of course, GSK itself has never made\n  this argument, despite having every incentive to do so\n  (given how Teva featured the declarations and their signif-\n  icance to the jury, the district court, and this court). It\u2019s\n  easy to guess why: the FDA confirms that the declarations\n  are available to the public. 68 Fed. Reg. at 36,683.\n      At any rate, the majority\u2019s confidentiality conjecture is\n  a red herring. Even if it were true that Teva never laid\n  eyes on GSK\u2019s exact documents, it wouldn\u2019t matter. As no\n  one disputes, Teva asked to carve out GSK\u2019s patented uses,\n  and the FDA in return used GSK\u2019s representations to pro-\n  vide Teva with a carved-out label. The FDA itself took no\n  non-infringement position; GSK did. And so by accepting\n  the FDA-provided skinny label, which hewed to GSK\u2019s pa-\n  tent declarations, Teva relied on GSK\u2019s representations of\n  patent scope. 12 See, e.g., Cross-Appellant\u2019s Br. 12\u201313,\n  51\u201352; J.A. 12475 (Teva\u2019s JMOL motion).\n\n\n\n      11  The suggestion appears to be based on the word\n  \u201cconfidential\u201d at the bottom of the declarations\u2019 pages in\n  our appendix. See Maj. 23. The majority\u2019s reliance on this\n  branding seems misplaced. Among documents similarly\n  branded \u201cconfidential\u201d: (1) the American College of Cardi-\n  ology\/American Heart Association Guidelines, published in\n  the Journal of American College of Cardiology, J.A. 3245;\n  and (2) Teva\u2019s 2012 Monthly Prescribing Reference,\n  J.A. 6192, a circulation that the majority says doctors re-\n  ceived \u201con a regular basis,\u201d Maj. 33 (quoting\n  J.A. 10607\u201308).\n      12  To that end, the declarations also belie GSK\u2019s in-\n  sistence that the 240-character use code was \u201cnot tied to\n  any particular indication.\u201d See Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 30.\n  GSK submitted a patent declaration identifying only one\n  indication. E.g., J.A. 6895. From that declaration came\n  the use code. GSK\u2019s use-code argument is therefore wrong\n  as a matter of law here. And regardless, GSK\u2019s problem\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 58    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  18 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n      Everything that follows must be assessed against the\n  carve-out backdrop. With that in mind, I turn to what re-\n  mained of the label after it was carved out. For a drug label\n  to induce, it must \u201cencourage, recommend, or promote in-\n  fringement.\u201d Takeda, 785 F.3d at 631. \u201cMerely describing\n  an infringing use\u201d in a label \u201cwill not suffice.\u201d HZNP Meds.\n  LLC v. Actavis Labs. UT, Inc., 940 F.3d 680, 702 (Fed. Cir.\n  2019); Takeda, 785 F.3d at 631.\n      The majority supports the verdict with GSK\u2019s expert\n  testimony concerning the post-MI LVD indication. Again,\n  this indication remained on the label because GSK\u2019s sworn\n  declarations never said it was patented. Dr. McCullough\n  did walk through claim 1 of the \u2019000 patent and compare\n  each limitation to somewhere on the skinny label.\n  Maj. 14\u201316 (citing testimony at J.A. 10623\u201331). But he\n  never testified that the skinny label encouraged, recom-\n  mended, or promoted practicing the claimed method. 13\n\n\n\n  remains part 4.2a of the declarations, which required GSK\n  to \u201c[s]ubmit indication or method of use information as\n  identified specifically in the approved labeling.\u201d E.g.,\n  J.A. 6895 (emphasis added).\n      13   The majority suggests otherwise, via a misleading\n  cite to a snippet of testimony. See Maj. 24 (citing\n  J.A. 10644). While Dr. McCullough did testify that Teva\n  \u201ctook action\u201d intended to encourage, none of the evidence\n  he was referencing included the skinny label itself. His\n  earlier skinny-label testimony concerned underlying direct\n  infringement. E.g., J.A. 10631. But after moving to the\n  intent element of inducement, where the majority finds this\n  testimony, the label did not come up again\u2014neither di-\n  rectly nor indirectly. J.A. 10634\u201344. This may explain why\n  GSK never cited this testimony to show that the skinny la-\n  bel encouraged. Had GSK done so, Teva would have had\n  an opportunity to contest the characterization the majority\n  now adopts.\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 59    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.       19\n\n\n\n  Rather, in response to a series of questions about whether\n  certain portions of the label \u201cmet\u201d the claim limitations, he\n  testified that some limitations were met (or \u201cmentioned\u201d)\n  in the Indications and Usage section, others in the Dosage\n  and Administration section, and still others in the Clinical\n  Studies section. J.A. 10623\u201331. At most, a reasonable jury\n  could have found that the skinny label described the in-\n  fringing use (if pieced together just right), in the context of\n  post-MI LVD patients. Describing is not enough.\n      This failure of proof alone should end the intentional-\n  encouragement inquiry as to the skinny label here. But\n  when we also consider the backdrop as to how the skinny\n  label arose\u2014i.e., that Teva took out the only indication\n  GSK said was patented\u2014the lack of inducement based on\n  this label is beyond dispute. See Vita-Mix Corp. v. Basic\n  Holding, Inc., 581 F.3d 1317, 1329 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2009)\n  (\u201c[The question] is whether [defendant\u2019s] instructions\n  teach an infringing use . . . such that we are willing to infer\n  from those instructions an affirmative intent to infringe\n  the patent.\u201d (emphasis added)); see also Grokster, 545 U.S.\n  at 937 (\u201cThe classic instance of inducement is by advertise-\n  ment . . . that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate\n  others to commit violations.\u201d (emphasis added)). The law\n  simply does not permit an inference of culpable, intentional\n  encouragement from the label on this record. 14\n\n\n\n      14  Despite the majority\u2019s characterization, this is not\n  a contention that estoppel arose from GSK\u2019s FDA filings.\n  Maj. 23. Rather, the issue concerns what intent could be\n  reasonably gleaned from the skinny label, given the way\n  that label came about and the absence of other evidence of\n  intent. Intent is a required element of inducement\u2014and,\n  as the majority itself acknowledges, GSK\u2019s failure to list\n  the post-MI LVD indication in its FDA filings \u201cis relevant\n  to intent to induce infringement.\u201d Id. at 20. Estoppel is a\n  separate issue based on a different legal standard that the\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 60     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  20 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n      All of that is just the intentional-encouragement prong\n  though; GSK also had to show causation. At a minimum,\n  it had to prove that doctors would have read the skinny la-\n  bel, then pieced together the disparate portions just like\n  Dr. McCullough did at trial, then viewed that pieced-to-\n  gether description as an encouragement to prescribe carve-\n  dilol for CHF according to the specific limitations of the\n  claimed method, and then relied on that pieced-together\n  message to make that prescribing decision.\n      Dr. McCullough certainly didn\u2019t connect these dots. In-\n  deed, he would have been a poor choice for that task. A\n  question arose at trial as to whether he had even read the\n  label before making his prescribing decisions. To survive a\n  pre-verdict JMOL motion on causation, GSK\u2019s counsel\n  promised the trial judge that if given another chance,\n  Dr. McCullough would \u201cabsolutely\u201d testify that he did so.\n  J.A. 10959; see also J.A. 10959 (counsel insisting that \u201cob-\n  viously, he always reads the label\u201d). But when given the\n  chance, he testified that no, he didn\u2019t read the label before\n  making his prescribing decisions. J.A. 11662\u201363. Not that\n  Dr. McCullough was alone in this regard; the other two ex-\n  pert cardiologists at trial testified that they didn\u2019t do so ei-\n  ther.     J.A. 11151 (Dr. Zusman); J.A. 11296\u201397\n  (Dr. Rosendorff).\n      Nothing else connected these dots. In fact, evidence\n  from both sides showed that doctors relied primarily on\n\n\n  district court may resolve in the first instance. The major-\n  ity\u2019s charge that I seek to \u201cleapfrog\u201d and resolve estoppel\n  here on appeal is therefore disturbingly off-base. Id. at 23.\n  I am instead addressing what a reasonable jury could find\n  Teva\u2019s intent to be. I do not understand the majority to be\n  suggesting that the potential availability of a different type\n  of relief (i.e., estoppel) forecloses the court from considering\n  the main issue in this appeal (i.e., inducement) if resolution\n  of the two issues might involve some of the same facts.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 61     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      21\n\n\n\n  medical guidelines, experience, education, and journals\n  when making their prescribing decisions. E.g., J.A. 10668,\n  10676\u201377 (Dr. McCullough), 11151\u201352, 11164\u201368 (Dr. Zus-\n  man), 11296\u201397 (Dr. Rosendorff). Evidence from both sides\n  also showed that pharmacies substituted generics for the\n  brand version automatically, as all fifty states allow or\n  even require. See, e.g., J.A. 10678\u201379 (Dr. McCullough),\n  10750\u201351 (Dr. Reisetter), 11038 (Mr. Karst), 11076\u201377\n  (Ms. Kinsey). The majority, however, disregards this un-\n  controverted, direct evidence of causation in favor of letting\n  unsupported inferences bridge GSK\u2019s evidentiary gap. It\n  starts with the label\u2019s contents and that they were perhaps\n  \u201cread\u201d\u2014then ends up at causation. Maj. 35\u201336. I disagree\n  with the majority that this inferential leap is \u201cfair,\u201d id.\n  at 36, particularly here, where direct evidence across the\n  board points to medical texts and expertise as being the\n  main influence. In my view, \u201cfair\u201d would be ensuring that\n  causation means something. See infra Part II.C.2.\n      Before turning to the press releases, one last, critical\n  point bears mentioning. The majority confines its reliance\n  on the skinny label to the post-MI LVD indication. In par-\n  ticular, its skinny-label inducement path starts with \u201cen-\n  couragement\u201d from the post-MI LVD indication, and ends\n  in direct infringement when a doctor prescribes carvedilol\n  for any post-MI LVD patient who also happens to have\n  CHF (assuming that the rest of the claim limitations are\n  met when so prescribing). See Maj. 13\u201316, 18\u201319. Notably,\n  however, as both sides acknowledge, the damages award in\n  this case was not confined to just the appropriate subset of\n  infringing prescriptions to post-MI LVD patients who also\n  had CHF\u2014it encompassed CHF patients more broadly.\n  Cross-Appellant\u2019s Br. 54; see Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 31\u201332.\n  GSK\u2019s damages testimony was not predicated on, nor did it\n  quantify, the subset of uses that would infringe under the\n  majority\u2019s skinny-label-based inducement theory.\n      Recognizing the problem, GSK leans on the press re-\n  leases to save the full damages award; it says they\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 62    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  22 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  \u201cencouraged the infringing use for all . . . symptomatic\n  heart failure patients.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 31. But, as I\n  explain below, that\u2019s far too much weight for these press\n  releases to bear. Accordingly, even if the majority\u2019s uphold-\n  ing the verdict on the basis of the skinny label were appro-\n  priate, we would have to remand this case for a proper\n  damages calculation. But Teva\u2019s argument on this im-\n  portant issue goes unacknowledged in the majority\u2019s opin-\n  ion.\n                   2. The 2007 Press Release\n      Beyond the skinny label itself, the majority also sup-\n  ports the verdict with a 2007 Teva press release that an-\n  nounced final FDA approval for Teva to market its\n  \u201c[g]eneric version of [GSK\u2019s] cardiovascular agent Coreg\u00ae\n  (Carvedilol) Tablets.\u201d Maj. 29 (citing J.A. 6353). From this\n  press release\u2014which was distributed before the \u2019000 pa-\n  tent issued but apparently appeared on Teva\u2019s website dur-\n  ing the patent\u2019s term\u2014the majority permits inferences of\n  intentional encouragement and causation. Neither is rea-\n  sonable.\n       As to intentional encouragement, the majority inter-\n  prets Teva\u2019s 2007 press release as saying that its product\n  is a \u201cgeneric equivalent of GSK\u2019s cardiovascular agent\n  Coreg\u00ae,\u201d id. at 30\u2014and, from this, permits the inference\n  that Teva intended to encourage substitution of its product\n  for all of Coreg\u2019s indications, including CHF, id. at 29\u201330.\n  In other words, the majority holds that a generic can be\n  deemed liable for inducement for saying that its product is\n  a \u201cgeneric version\u201d or \u201cgeneric equivalent\u201d of a brand drug.\n  This is a drastic holding. And it makes little sense. Essen-\n  tially all ANDA generics are the \u201cgeneric version\u201d or \u201cge-\n  neric equivalent\u201d of a brand drug; the law requires them to\n  be. To come to market, such a generic must demonstrate\n  that its product is bioequivalent to a brand drug. 21 U.S.C.\n  \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(iv), (j)(4)(F); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.94(a)(7)(i); see\n  also 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.92(a) (noting that, with limited\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 63     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      23\n\n\n\n  exceptions not relevant here, ANDAs are suitable only for\n  \u201c[d]rug products that are the same as a listed drug,\u201d and\n  that \u201cthe same as\u201d includes drugs with label modifications\n  made for patent carve-outs). See generally supra Part I.A.\n  The system is inherently comparative. I therefore find it\n  highly unlikely that Congress intended to make generics\n  liable for simply stating what the law requires.\n      The majority also sees culpable intent in Teva\u2019s de-\n  scribing its product as a \u201ccardiovascular\u201d agent. See\n  Maj. 29\u201330. A well-understood adjective, \u201ccardiovascular\u201d\n  means relating to the heart. Carvedilol is a heart-related\n  drug; it\u2019s used to treat CHF, post-MI LVD, and hyperten-\n  sion\u2014all heart-related conditions. I cannot see how using\n  the word \u201ccardiovascular\u201d to describe a heart-related drug\n  could reasonably be viewed as evidencing culpable intent\n  to encourage practicing the specific claimed CHF method\n  in particular here\u2014or how this adjective does anything be-\n  yond what \u201cgeneric version\u201d or \u201cgeneric equivalent\u201d do in\n  terms of intent.\n      And still there remains causation. The majority never\n  explains how a reasonable jury could have found that this\n  press release (as it later appeared on Teva\u2019s website) af-\n  fected doctors\u2019 prescribing practices so as to cause their in-\n  fringement. Indeed, outside of testimony that doctors \u201cget\u201d\n  press releases, J.A. 11655, and that it\u2019s \u201cpossible\u201d doctors\n  read them, J.A. 11239, GSK supplied no evidence that any\n  doctor read this one before the litigation\u2014much less ac-\n  cessed it from Teva\u2019s website, and was then so moved by it\n  that it caused him or her to prescribe carvedilol in an in-\n  fringing manner, trumping every medical text along the\n  way.\n      We simply have a press release that describes a generic\n  version of a cardiovascular brand drug as a \u201cgeneric ver-\n  sion\u201d of a \u201ccardiovascular\u201d brand drug. From that alone,\n  the majority permits inferences of culpable intent to\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 64     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  24 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  encourage and causation. I fail to see how those inferences\n  are reasonable.\n                  3. The 2004 Press Release\n      The majority\u2019s final key piece of evidence is the 2004\n  press release, which announced Teva\u2019s \u201ctentative [FDA]\n  approval\u201d to market its product, described as \u201cthe AB-rated\n  generic equivalent of [GSK\u2019s] Coreg\u00ae . . . indicated for\n  treatment of heart failure and hypertension.\u201d J.A. 6347.\n      Before turning to whether these statements could show\n  intentional encouragement to infringe, some undisputed\n  facts must be acknowledged. First, this press release was\n  distributed several years before the \u2019000 patent issued, at\n  a time when Teva was pursuing a different pathway to reg-\n  ulatory approval. At that time, Teva\u2019s product was indi-\n  cated for treatment of CHF. But Teva ultimately pursued\n  the section viii pathway. Second, the press release an-\n  nounced the product\u2019s \u201ctentative approval,\u201d which has a\n  specific, legal meaning\u2014namely, that a patent or regula-\n  tory exclusivity stands in the way of final approval.\n  21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv)(II)(dd)(A); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.3(b);\n  see J.A. 10533. In other words, this \u201capproval\u201d had condi-\n  tions.\n      With that in mind, the question remains: what is there\n  in this press release to suggest intent to encourage in-\n  fringement of the (future-issued) \u2019000 patent? Like the\n  2007 press release, the majority sees culpable intent in\n  Teva\u2019s describing its product as the \u201cAB-rated generic\n  equivalent\u201d of Coreg. Maj. 28. But, for the reasons de-\n  scribed above, this cannot plausibly support liability within\n  Congress\u2019s framework in this area. And although the press\n  release does reference \u201cheart failure,\u201d given the circum-\n  stances here\u2014i.e., that the press release was distributed\n  years before the patent issued (under materially different\n  regulatory circumstances) and announced \u201ctentative\u201d ap-\n  proval\u2014inferring culpable intent from this press release\n  exceeds the bounds of reasonableness.\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 65    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.       25\n\n\n\n      And again: causation. To prove it, GSK first had to\n  show that Teva made this years-old press release available\n  on its website during the patent\u2019s term. This should have\n  been a crucial showing\u2014after all, this press release is one\n  of the three key pieces of evidence the majority relies on.\n  Once again, though, direct evidence is missing. And once\n  again, the majority is untroubled. It simply calls up some\n  inferences to bridge the gap. In particular, the majority\n  suggests the inference that, because the 2007 press release\n  was on Teva\u2019s website, and because Teva had a website\n  with some information about carvedilol, the 2004 press re-\n  lease must have been there too. Maj. 30\u201331. GSK, for its\n  part, never argued any of these inferences to the jury. And\n  while the majority faults Teva for not showing that the\n  2004 press release was not there, id. at 31, this is GSK\u2019s\n  case and its burden\u2014and besides, it\u2019s hard to blame Teva\n  for not rebutting a fact that GSK never even tried estab-\n  lishing.\n       But, for argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s assume the jury could\n  have reasonably found that GSK carried its burden on this\n  point. A further question remains: what is there to suggest\n  that any doctor saw it\u2014years later on the website\u2014then\n  relied on that as the basis for his or her infringing prescrib-\n  ing decisions? The answer: nothing. At least, that\u2019s the\n  answer the majority gives. See id. at 35\u201337. Nothing in\n  the record suggested that doctors were in the habit of\n  searching a generic\u2019s website for old press releases to help\n  them make life-or-death prescribing decisions. The most\n  we have is that Dr. McCullough saw the 2004 press release\n  (timing unspecified) and that it said what it said. The rest\n  is left to sheer possibility.\n      And indeed, it\u2019s possible that things panned out this\n  way. Maybe a doctor did search Teva\u2019s website for old\n  press releases, found this one (assuming it was there), and\n  then relied on that press release to make his or her pre-\n  scribing decision (at least three years after the date of this\n  press release), trumping every medical text along the way.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 66     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  26 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  Maybe every relevant doctor did. Many things are possible.\n  But \u201c\u2018[m]ere speculation\u2019 is not substantial evidence.\u201d OSI\n  Pharms., LLC v. Apotex Inc., 939 F.3d 1375, 1382 (Fed. Cir.\n  2019) (quoting Intell. Ventures I LLC v. Motorola Mobility\n  LLC, 870 F.3d 1320, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).\n      In sum, the 2004 press release\u2019s description of Teva\u2019s\n  product as the \u201cAB-rated generic equivalent\u201d of Coreg,\n  along with its reference to \u201cheart failure,\u201d would be a slen-\n  der enough reed upon which to rest culpable intent, given\n  that this communique was distributed years before the pa-\n  tent issued (under materially different regulatory circum-\n  stances) and announced an approval that was only\n  \u201ctentative.\u201d But it\u2019s the causation that truly vexes me. It\u2019s\n  the notion that, instead of the various medical texts (and\n  experience, and education), all along it was really the 2004\n  press release, found years later on the website, that caused\n  doctors\u2019 CHF prescribing decisions. In the face of uncon-\n  troverted evidence of the former, some evidence of the lat-\n  ter should be necessary. But there\u2019s none.\n   4. The Supposedly Substantial Other Evidence of Intent\n       The majority calls it \u201cinaccurate\u201d to observe that it re-\n  lies on only three key pieces of evidence as to culpable in-\n  tent during the skinny-label period. Maj. 24. It says\n  there\u2019s additional evidence too. 15 But while the majority\n  discusses the three pieces above in some detail, it only ges-\n  tures to the rest without much meaningful discussion.\n  Such references can hardly be enough to sustain a verdict,\n  and they return us to the uncertainty concerns plaguing\n  the first, vacated version of the majority\u2019s opinion. At\n\n\n\n      15 Much of this evidence comes in the form of trial tes-\n  timony that was not included in the record on appeal\u2014\n  which means it\u2019s testimony that GSK didn\u2019t rely on, and to\n  which Teva therefore had no occasion to respond. Anything\n  the majority cites as \u201cTrial Tr.\u201d references such testimony.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 67    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.     27\n\n\n\n  bottom, however, this other evidence just relates back to\n  the three key pieces.\n       There was \u201cextensive expert testimony,\u201d the majority\n  first insists without elaboration. Maj. 24. As best I can\n  tell, the majority is referring to Dr. McCullough and\n  Dr. Zusman, see id. at 26\u2014Dr. McCullough saying that doc-\n  tors read labels, and Dr. Zusman agreeing that Teva\u2019s cir-\n  culations suggested reading labels if doctors have\n  questions. So, we\u2019re back to the skinny label\u2014the first of\n  the three key pieces of evidence. And if the skinny label\n  doesn\u2019t show intent, then neither does suggesting that doc-\n  tors should read it. 16\n      Teva\u2019s \u201cMonthly Prescribing References\u201d get some at-\n  tention elsewhere. See id. at 26\u201327. But, like the \u201cexten-\n  sive\u201d expert testimony discussed above, that\u2019s just for the\n  proposition that Teva intended doctors to read its labels.\n  Again, back to the skinny label.\n       The majority adds to the list Teva\u2019s \u201cproduct catalogs\u201d\n  and \u201cadvertising and promotional activities.\u201d Id. at 24. I\n  presume it means Teva\u2019s catalogs discussed shortly after-\n  ward. But the only thing for which that evidence was relied\n  on was to show that Teva described its drug as the \u201cAB\n  rated\u201d equivalent to Coreg. See id. at 27 (discussing 2008\n  and 2009 catalogs at J.A. 6221 and J.A. 6270). Statements\n  of equivalence were discussed with respect to the two press\n  releases\u2014the other two key pieces of evidence. So it\u2019s un-\n  clear what this adds to the intent calculus. And as before,\n  if this is evidence of intent, we should be disturbed.\n\n\n\n\n      16  Of course, because causation is an element, what\n  matters in the end is whether doctors did in fact not only\n  read but also rely on this label. See supra pp. 20\u201321. Recall\n  too that every relevant witness testified that he hadn\u2019t read\n  this label before prescribing.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 68    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  28 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n       Finally, the majority notes \u201ctestimony from Teva\u2019s own\n  company witnesses.\u201d Id. at 24. Maybe this means Teva\u2019s\n  marketing director (who the majority says \u201cadded carve-\n  dilol product information to the Teva website\u201d in 2007) and\n  regulatory-affairs director (who the majority says \u201cdis-\n  cussed\u201d the press releases with the jury). See id. at 31.\n  Whatever the case, this discussion just concerns the press\n  releases\u2014well-trodden ground. Or maybe instead the ma-\n  jority means Mr. Rekenthaler, who it quotes as having \u201cex-\n  pected\u201d or \u201cassum[ed]\u201d that doctors would use drugs as\n  labeled. Id. at 27. But this just brings us back to the\n  skinny label.\n      The bottom line is that, to the extent that this evidence\n  is relevant, its relevance depends on finding culpability\n  from the three key pieces of evidence\u2014i.e., the skinny label\n  or the two press releases, particularly their statements of\n  equivalence.\n                   B. The Full-Label Period\n      As with the skinny-label period, JMOL of no induce-\n  ment was necessary for the full-label period. The reason is\n  simple: nothing about doctors\u2019 prescribing practices\n  changed when Teva amended its label to the full version.\n  Both GSK and its experts confirmed as much. Appellant\u2019s\n  Br. 21 (\u201cDoctors continued to administer Teva\u2019s accused\n  product for infringing use during [the full-label] period\n  (without change from the partial label period) . . . .\u201d (em-\n  phasis added)); J.A. 12204\u201305 (GSK\u2019s counsel conceding\n  that any market impact as a result of the amendment was\n  \u201cminimal\u201d); J.A. 10699 (Dr. McCullough agreeing that, in\n  his practice, there was \u201cno difference in [his] prescribing\n  habits from when Teva had its skinny label to after Teva\n  amended to have its full label\u201d); J.A. 10754 (different GSK\n  expert testifying that his survey of 200 doctors indicated no\n  change in prescription patterns from pre- to post-amend-\n  ment).\n\fCase: 18-1976       Document: 187     Page: 69      Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.          29\n\n\n\n      The majority, for its part, identifies nothing about doc-\n  tors\u2019 prescribing practices that changed after Teva\n  amended its label. Maj. 33\u201337. If nothing about this\n  changed, then nothing Teva did during the full-label period\n  could have caused anything beyond whatever caused direct\n  infringement during the skinny-label period. And because\n  the record lacks evidence that Teva caused direct infringe-\n  ment during the skinny-label period, Teva cannot have\n  caused direct infringement during the full-label period\u2014\n  and therefore cannot have induced.\n           C. Why the Majority\u2019s Flawed Analysis Matters\n       In reinstating the jury\u2019s unsupportable verdict, the ma-\n  jority commits several errors\u2014some legal, some practical,\n  and all spelling trouble for skinny labels specifically and\n  inducement law generally. Below are three main concerns\n  with the majority\u2019s approach.\n             1. The Majority Weakens the Intentional-\n             Encouragement Requirement as to Labels\n       Direct infringement is strict liability; induced infringe-\n  ment is not. And when it comes to inducement\u2019s inten-\n  tional-encouragement requirement, the law draws a line\n  between encouraging, recommending, or promoting an in-\n  fringing use and merely describing that use. E.g., Takeda,\n  785 F.3d at 631. This line is important because while the\n  former provides evidence of intent, the latter does not. See\n  id. (collecting cases); HZNP, 940 F.3d at 702 (\u201cMerely de-\n  scribing an infringing use . . . will not suffice . . . .\u201d). The\n  majority blurs this line beyond recognition. 17\n\n\n\n      17   GSK would have us ignore this line entirely. Ap-\n  pellant\u2019s Reply Br. 28 (\u201cIt is doubtful whether such a dis-\n  tinction actually exists . . . .\u201d); see id. at 16 (\u201cTeva\u2019s partial\n  label encouraged doctors to infringe GSK\u2019s patent because\n  it described every limitation of the claimed method.\u201d).\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 70    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  30 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n       Take the skinny label here.            GSK\u2019s expert\n  Dr. McCullough, despite having never read the label him-\n  self before making prescribing decisions, walked through it\n  and found piecemeal language that he could say \u201cmet\u201d or\n  \u201cmentioned\u201d each claim limitation in isolation. Supra\n  pp. 18\u201319. That was the extent of it. There was no testi-\n  mony or other evidence that this label language encour-\n  aged practicing the patented method, or that it even came\n  with a wink or nudge. At most, then, a reasonable jury\n  could have found that the skinny label described the in-\n  fringing use.\n       The majority somehow ends up at encouragement but\n  fails to justify how it got there. In particular, it never\n  meaningfully engages with the legal distinction between\n  encouraging, recommending, or promoting an infringing\n  use and describing it. Nor does it explain how a reasonable\n  jury could have found the former from the latter on this\n  record. If a jury can simply infer culpable intent to encour-\n  age from a mere description, the legal distinction is mean-\n  ingless.    Description would always suffice to infer\n  inducement.\n      That\u2019s a problem. \u201c[S]howing that infringement was\n  encouraged\u201d is necessary to \u201covercome[] the law\u2019s reluc-\n  tance to find liability when a defendant merely sells\u201d a\n  product with legitimate non-infringing uses, like carve-\n  dilol. Grokster, 545 U.S. at 936; see id. at 937 (acknowledg-\n  ing \u201cthe need to keep from trenching on regular commerce\n  or discouraging the development of technologies with law-\n  ful and unlawful potential\u201d). \u201cThis requirement of induc-\n  ing acts is particularly important in the Hatch-Waxman\n  Act context because the statute was designed to enable the\n  sale of drugs for non-patented uses even though this would\n  result in some off-label infringing uses.\u201d Takeda, 785 F.3d\n  at 631 (citing Caraco, 566 U.S. at 414\u201315).\n     On that note, I emphasize that this criticism is all\n  about how the majority treats what was left of the skinny\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 71     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.         31\n\n\n\n  label after the carve-out. That Teva first carved out exactly\n  what GSK said would infringe should settle the question of\n  what intent could be reasonably inferred from the label it-\n  self on these facts. It\u2019s also a circumstance that distin-\n  guishes every case the majority relies on to support its\n  holding.\n                2. The Majority Eviscerates the\n                    Causation Requirement\n      Patent infringement is a tort. E.g., Wordtech Sys., Inc.\n  v. Integrated Networks Sols., Inc., 609 F.3d 1308, 1313\n  (Fed. Cir. 2010); see Carbice Corp. of Am. v. Am. Pats. Dev.\n  Corp., 283 U.S. 27, 33 (1931). Accordingly, liability at-\n  taches only to one who causes the injury\u2014here, practice of\n  the patented method. Legal cause, not simply but-for\n  cause, is required. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 9\n  cmt. a.\n      Traditional tort principles inform how a plaintiff\n  proves, or fails to prove, causation:\n      As on other issues in civil cases, the plaintiff is re-\n      quired to produce evidence that the conduct of the\n      defendant has been a substantial factor in bringing\n      about the harm he has suffered, and to sustain his\n      burden of proof by a preponderance of the evi-\n      dence. . . . A mere possibility of such causation is\n      not enough; and when the matter remains one of\n      pure speculation and conjecture, or the probabilities\n      are at best evenly balanced, it becomes the duty of\n      the court to direct a verdict for the defendant.\n  Id. \u00a7 433B cmt. a (emphasis added); see also id. \u00a7 876 cmt. d\n  (noting that if \u201cencouragement or assistance is a substan-\n  tial factor in causing [a] resulting tort, the one giving it is\n  himself a tortfeasor\u201d). Therefore, to prove causation, GSK\n  had to show that Teva\u2019s conduct (apart from simply being\n  on the market) was a substantial factor in causing doctors\n  to prescribe its carvedilol in an infringing way. A mere\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 72     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  32 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  possibility wouldn\u2019t do; rather, a reasonable jury must have\n  been able to find that it was more likely than not. Here it\n  could not.\n      To start, the majority identifies no direct evidence of\n  causation by Teva. And it casts aside the direct evidence\n  from both sides pointing to the same things\u2014things other\n  than Teva\u2014as the cause. Supra pp. 20\u201321, 23\u201326. In-\n  stead, it says that it was \u201cfair\u201d for the jury to \u201cinfer\u201d causa-\n  tion from the existence of the skinny label itself and the\n  two press releases. Maj. 36. This conclusion relies on a\n  passing observation in one case saying: \u201c[W]e have af-\n  firmed induced infringement verdicts based on circumstan-\n  tial evidence of inducement (e.g., advertisements, user\n  manuals) directed to a class of direct infringers (e.g., cus-\n  tomers, end users) without requiring hard proof that any\n  individual third-party direct infringer was actually per-\n  suaded to infringe by that material.\u201d Id. (quoting Power\n  Integrations, Inc. v. Fairchild Semiconductor Int\u2019l, Inc.,\n  843 F.3d 1315, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2016)). But this observation\n  is not a license to substitute speculation for proof. The ev-\n  idence-to-conclusion link must always make sense.\n       In some inducement cases, a jury might reasonably in-\n  fer causation based solely on circumstantial evidence. One\n  example might be where a product\u2019s user manual encour-\n  ages an infringing use, and where the user had no famili-\n  arity with the product other than the manual. A reasonable\n  jury might infer that the manual caused the user, other-\n  wise unfamiliar with the product\u2019s intricacies, to use the\n  product that way, and we have upheld inducement verdicts\n  on this basis. E.g., Golden Blount, Inc. v. Robert H. Peter-\n  son Co., 438 F.3d 1354, 1362\u201363 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (causation\n  evidence included an instruction sheet teaching infringe-\n  ment and packaged with each product); ArthroCare Corp.\n  v. Smith & Nephew, Inc., 406 F.3d 1365, 1377 (Fed. Cir.\n  2005) (causation evidence included \u201csales literature accom-\n  panying one of the accused devices\u201d and other instruction\n  manuals recommending an infringing use); Moleculon\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 73     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      33\n\n\n\n  Rsch. Corp. v. CBS, Inc., 793 F.2d 1261, 1272 (Fed. Cir.\n  1986) (causation evidence included \u201cdissemination of an in-\n  struction sheet teaching\u201d the infringing method). Although\n  purely circumstantial, the inferential hops are few and\n  short. In those cases, what else but the user manual might\n  have caused the user to use the product in an infringing\n  way? Cf. Golden Blount, 438 F.3d at 1363 (\u201c[N]othing in\n  the record suggests that either [defendant] or any end-user\n  ignored the instructions . . . .\u201d).\n      In other inducement cases, inferential leaps are too\n  many and too great, and evidence of a different cause too\n  strong, for the circumstantial evidence that is offered to\n  carry the day. Take this case. To accept that Teva\u2019s skinny\n  label was a substantial factor in causing doctors to infringe,\n  one would have to infer doctors read it to make prescribing\n  decisions (even though all three testifying expert cardiolo-\n  gists said they didn\u2019t); infer those doctors pieced together\n  the portions of the label to uncover a description of the in-\n  fringing use (maybe); infer those doctors interpreted that\n  description as an encouragement (no evidence); and then\n  infer those doctors relied on that description to make their\n  prescribing decisions (no evidence). Supra pp. 20\u201321. As\n  to the press releases, one would have to infer Teva made\n  them available during the relevant time period (maybe);\n  infer doctors read them during that time (no evidence); and\n  then infer doctors relied on some inducing message therein\n  to make prescribing decisions affecting their patients\u2019\n  health (no evidence). 18 Supra pp. 23\u201326.\n     Unlike the prototypical user-manual case, in which we\n  might permit the inference that a user relied on the man-\n  ual without requiring testimony to that effect, the\n\n\n      18   This is to say nothing of the causal implications of\n  pharmacies\u2019 ubiquitous automatic-substitution practices\u2014\n  where, for example, a doctor might write \u201cCoreg,\u201d but a ge-\n  neric is dispensed nonetheless.

TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  inference might not hold up as well in this context\u2014with\n  highly educated users and well-studied products. And\n  whatever strength the inference has in a context such as\n  this, it crumbles when, as here, we have users who testi-\n  fied, and they either (1) failed to say they relied or (2) af-\n  firmatively said they didn\u2019t rely on the allegedly inducing\n  materials.\n       Moreover, unlike the prototypical user-manual case,\n  it\u2019s not as though the record here was wanting for another\n  cause. Both sides\u2019 expert cardiologists said under oath and\n  without contradiction that medical texts, education, and\n  experience caused their prescribing decisions. Supra\n  pp. 20\u201321. Under these circumstances, would accepting\n  the Teva-caused version of events amount to anything\n  more than speculation, given the chain of inferences re-\n  quired\u2014not all of them reasonably grounded in the record\n  evidence?\n      The most troubling part of all this is that the majority\n  never explains how a reasonable jury could have come out\n  this way on this record. Given the size of the infringing\n  doctor class here, it should have been easy to present testi-\n  mony of causation if that theory had a basis in fact. Cf.\n  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2212 (2021)\n  (pointing to evidence that could have been sought and cit-\n  ing Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, 306 U.S. 208,\n  226 (1939), for the proposition that \u201c[t]he production of\n  weak evidence when strong is available can lead only to the\n  conclusion that the strong would have been adverse\u201d). But\n  not a single doctor testified as to causation by Teva, and in\n  fact, the most on-point testimony shows the absence of cau-\n  sation.\n      As a doctrinal matter, the majority\u2019s opinion suggests\n  that there is no independent causation element for induce-\n  ment; intentional encouragement might always suffice to\n  infer causation too. Add that to the majority\u2019s weakening\n  of intentional encouragement (where describing an\n\fCase: 18-1976      Document: 187     Page: 75     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.        35\n\n\n\n  infringing use piecemeal\u2014or simply calling a product a \u201cge-\n  neric version\u201d or \u201cgeneric equivalent\u201d\u2014is now enough), and\n  finding inducement becomes possible based largely on\n  speculation. The law requires more from a plaintiff.\n                3. The Majority Creates Confusion\n                      About Skinny Labels\n      The majority\u2019s opinion will create confusion for every-\n  one. Under its analysis, the difference is indiscernible be-\n  tween this case and one in which the generic is safe.\n  Indeed, it\u2019s unclear what Teva even did wrong\u2014or, put an-\n  other way, what another generic in its shoes should do dif-\n  ferently.\n       Initially, the majority suggests that this is not a\n  skinny-label case. Nothing to see here, the majority reas-\n  sures concerned amici: the Act remains intact. See\n  Maj. 10\u201311. But it\u2019s hard to see how. As a matter of law,\n  this is a skinny-label case about the skinny-label provi-\n  sions. The Act\u2019s text makes that much clear: section viii by\n  its own terms references the brand-submitted patent \u201cin-\n  formation\u201d (i.e., patent declaration).              21 U.S.C.\n  \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(viii); see 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.53(c)(2)(O) (patent\n  \u201cinformation\u201d includes portions of label covered by method\n  patent). This patent information dictates whether a ge-\n  neric label is a section viii label. If a generic omits the uses\n  the brand has said are patented, the label is skinny. The\n  FDA understands that. See supra Part I.A (discussing\n  brand-dependent regulatory framework). So does the Su-\n  preme Court. Caraco, 566 U.S. at 404\u201307. So should we.\n      What\u2019s more, the background facts here will seemingly\n  persist in most skinny-label cases.         Under the Act,\n  \u201c[g]eneric copies\u201d are essentially \u201cthe same as the original\n  drug.\u201d See H.R. Rep. No. 98\u2013857, pt. 1, at 14\u201315; accord\n  21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(iv); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.92(a)(1). Thus, bi-\n  oequivalence; comparison to a brand drug; duplication of a\n  brand\u2019s label (at least in part); reliance on a brand\u2019s clini-\n  cal-trial data; references to a drug\u2019s therapeutic class;\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 76     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  36 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  cursory press releases announcing a generic\u2019s regulatory\n  approval; doctors\u2019 assumptions about what going generic\n  means; pharmacies\u2019 generic substitution; a generic\u2019s\n  knowledge that some sales may occur from off-label, in-\n  fringing uses\u2014all of that will generally be there whether\n  there is inducement or not. See, e.g., AstraZeneca Pharms.\n  LP v. Apotex Corp., 669 F.3d 1370, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2012)\n  (discussing \u201cmarket realities\u201d of substitution that do not\n  implicate infringement). Those facts cannot sort induce-\n  ment from non-inducement.\n      So where did Teva go wrong in this case? Should it not\n  have followed the brand\u2019s sworn representations as to what\n  was patented? The majority offers no principled division\n  between this and what it suggests would be a true skinny\n  label. For decades, everyone has assumed they could rely\n  on what brands said about what their patents covered. The\n  FDA\u2019s skinny-label approval pathway and regulations are\n  expressly predicated on that. As far as adherence to Con-\n  gress\u2019s framework, this was about as faithful as it gets.\n      Or is the takeaway, instead, that Congress meant to\n  expose ANDA generics to liability for simply describing\n  themselves as the \u201cgeneric version\u201d or \u201cgeneric equivalent\u201d\n  of a brand drug? Given that the Hatch-Waxman Act\u2019s\n  framework requires ANDA generics to be the same as a\n  brand drug, and that doctors understand what being a ge-\n  neric means, this seems a dubious proposition.\n       One of amici\u2019s key criticisms of the first version of the\n  majority\u2019s opinion was that it was unclear what among the\n  muddled mass of evidence actually formed the basis of lia-\n  bility. So too here. It\u2019s unclear whether the skinny label\n  was enough\u2014or whether the press releases were, or some\n  of the other ancillary evidence in the record, \u201call of which\u201d\n  the majority suggests the jury \u201ccould have relied on.\u201d\n  Maj. 24.\n      The lack of clarity extends to the majority\u2019s character-\n  ization of its holding as \u201ccase-specific.\u201d See id. at 10\u201311.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 77     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      37\n\n\n\n  For example, the majority\u2019s new opinion relies on the post-\n  MI LVD indication remaining on the skinny label as a po-\n  tentially \u201ccase-specific\u201d circumstance. See id. Not only is\n  this reliance problematic (for the reasons described above),\n  it\u2019s a mirage. If the majority were truly relying on this cir-\n  cumstance to distinguish this case, it would accept Teva\u2019s\n  argument that the damages should be confined to the ap-\n  propriate subset of infringing prescriptions to post-MI LVD\n  patients who also had CHF. See supra pp. 21\u201322. But,\n  given that this argument goes unacknowledged in the ma-\n  jority\u2019s opinion, the implication is that the press releases\n  alone\u2014with their references to \u201cgeneric version\u201d or \u201cge-\n  neric equivalent\u201d\u2014suffice to support the entire verdict, en-\n  compassing CHF patients more broadly. And if that\u2019s so,\n  then it\u2019s unclear why the majority\u2019s analysis of the skinny\n  label itself is relevant. Under the majority\u2019s holding, a\n  brand can just rely on statements of equivalence to capture\n  even that portion of the market that was specifically carved\n  out.\n      The only clear thing now is that no generic can know\n  until hit with the bill whether it\u2019s staying within the con-\n  fines of the law. Being unable to predictably rely on use\n  codes and patent declarations \u201cthrows a wrench\u201d into Con-\n  gress\u2019s skinny-label design. See Caraco, 566 U.S. at 419.\n                        III. CONCLUSION\n      Before today, there was an equilibrium to the skinny-\n  label system\u2014one that allowed companies to make in-\n  formed, responsible decisions in this area. If a generic\n  wanted to avoid patented uses, it had the simple expedient\n  of omitting from its label the uses the brand identified.\n  And if a brand wanted to block a skinny label containing a\n  use it thought was patented, it had the simple expedient of\n  including that use in its FDA patent declaration. That\n  equilibrium is no more.\n      So, what\u2019s next? We are now on the majority\u2019s second\n  opinion in this case. The first was vacated in light of Teva\u2019s\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187     Page: 78   Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  38 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v.

The\n Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved carve-\n dilol for three indications of use. By 1997, the FDA had\n approved carvedilol for treatment of hypertension and con-\n gestive heart failure (CHF). Then, in 2003, the FDA ap-\n proved carvedilol for a third use: to reduce cardiovascular\n\n\n\n     *    Chief Judge Kimberly A.

TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.       5\n\n\n\n mortality in patients suffering from left ventricular dys-\n function following a myocardial infarction, i.e., the\n \u201cpost-MI LVD\u201d indication.\n      When GSK began investigating carvedilol\u2019s use for\n treating CHF, beta-blockers were contraindicated for that\n use. This was because beta-blockers slow the heart rate\n and reduce the heart\u2019s ability to pump blood, a potentially\n deadly combination for patients with heart failure. Very\n few doctors or companies, therefore, saw the potential for\n investigating beta-blockers for treating CHF. Despite this\n skepticism, GSK spent years investigating, and conducting\n trials of, carvedilol for the treatment of heart failure. And\n at the time, the only known treatment for improving mor-\n tality rates in CHF patients was with angiotensin-convert-\n ing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Still, even with ACE\n inhibitors, patients continued to die from heart failure at\n high rates. It was not until the FDA approved GSK\u2019s\n Coreg\u00ae that using a beta-blocker to treat CHF became the\n standard of care for reducing mortality in heart failure pa-\n tients.\n     The carvedilol compound was patented in 1985. See\n U.S. Patent No. 4,503,067, expiration date March 5, 2007.\n In 1998, U.S. Patent No. 5,760,069 issued, which claimed a\n method of administering a combination of carvedilol and\n one or more of an ACE inhibitor, a diuretic, and digoxin to\n decrease mortality caused by CHF in a patient.\n      In March 2002, Teva filed an Abbreviated New Drug\n Application (ANDA) for FDA approval of its generic carve-\n dilol for all three indications. It certified, under Paragraph\n III of the Hatch-Waxman Act, 1 that it would not launch its\n product until the \u2019067 patent on the carvedilol compound\n expired      in    March      2007.         See    21   U.S.C.\n\n\n\n     1   Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restora-\n tion Act of 1984, Pub.

Teva also certified, under Para-\n graph IV, that the \u2019069 patent was \u201cinvalid, unenforceable,\n or not infringed.\u201d See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). On\n May 24, 2002, Teva sent GSK a Paragraph IV notice stat-\n ing that the claims of the \u2019069 patent are anticipated or\n would have been obvious. GSK did not sue Teva upon re-\n ceipt of the notice, and on November 25, 2003, GSK applied\n for reissue of the \u2019069 patent under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251. Teva\n received FDA \u201ctentative approval\u201d for its ANDA in 2004,\n \u201cfor treatment of heart failure and hypertension.\u201d\n J.A. 7437. The approval was to become effective when the\n \u2019067 patent expired in 2007.\n     On January 8, 2008, the PTO issued Reissue Patent\n No. RE40,000, and GSK notified the FDA on February 6,\n 2008. See J.A. 6880\u201382. The \u2019000 patent, asserted in this\n case, claims a method of decreasing mortality caused by\n CHF by administering carvedilol with at least one other\n therapeutic agent. See, e.g., \u2019000 patent, col. 1, ll. 17\u201325.\n Claim 1 recites:\n     1. A method of decreasing mortality caused by con-\n     gestive heart failure in a patient in need thereof\n     which comprises[:]\n     administering a therapeutically acceptable amount\n     of carvedilol in conjunction with one or more other\n     therapeutic agents, said agents being selected from\n     the group consisting of an angiotensin converting\n     enzyme inhibitor (ACE), a diuretic, and digoxin,\n     wherein the administering comprises administer-\n     ing to said patient daily maintenance dosages for a\n     maintenance period to decrease a risk of mortality\n     caused by congestive heart failure, and said mainte-\n     nance period is greater than six months.\n (emphasis in original).

In re-\n sponse to the FDA\u2019s request for information regarding its\n position on the \u2019000 patent, Teva told the FDA it believed\n it need not \u201cprovide certification to [the \u2019000 patent]\u201d be-\n cause it received final approval of its ANDA before the \u2019000\n patent issued. J.A. 5554.\n     On July 3, 2014, GSK sued Teva and Glenmark Phar-\n maceuticals USA, the two largest suppliers of generic car-\n vedilol, in the District of Delaware, alleging that each had\n induced infringement of the \u2019000 patent. The action\n against Glenmark was severed and stayed.\n     During a seven-day jury trial, Teva argued the asserted\n claims of the \u2019000 patent were invalid and not infringed.\n Teva argued it could not have induced infringement, at\n least prior to 2011, because it had \u201ccarved out\u201d the indica-\n tion and prescribing information for treatment of conges-\n tive heart failure in its 2007 label under section viii.

Id.\n     The jury found the \u2019000 patent was not invalid, that\n Teva induced infringement of claims 1\u20133 during the partial\n label period, and that Teva induced infringement of claims\n 1\u20133 and 6\u20139 during the full label period. The jury assessed\n damages based on a combination of lost profits and a rea-\n sonable royalty and found Teva\u2019s infringement willful.\n     The district court granted Teva\u2019s renewed motion for\n JMOL, stating that substantial evidence did not support\n the verdict of induced infringement because GSK failed to\n prove that Teva\u2019s alleged inducement, as opposed to other\n factors, actually caused physicians to directly infringe by\n prescribing generic carvedilol for the treatment of mild to\n severe CHF. Dist. Ct. Op. at 591. The district court ex-\n plained that \u201c[w]ithout proof of causation, which is an es-\n sential element of GSK\u2019s action, a finding of inducement\n cannot stand.\u201d Id.\n     The district court also determined no reasonable juror\n could have found induced infringement based on the\n post-MI LVD indication in Teva\u2019s partial label, which GSK\n had argued instructed practice of the claimed method. Id.\n at 592 n.9. Although the district court acknowledged there\n is some overlap with CHF patients and post-MI LVD pa-\n tients, it reasoned \u201cthe two indications are distinct and re-\n quire different clinical testing and different FDA approvals\n to treat.\u201d Id. It further reasoned infringement required\n carvedilol be \u201cprescribed to treat the risk of mortality\n caused by CHF.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original). The district\n court concluded a reasonable juror could not have found\n Teva\u2019s post-MI LVD indication \u201ccaused or even encouraged\n direct infringement\u201d of this claimed use.

Teva argued our October 2,\n  2020 decision could be broadly read to impose liability on\n  ANDA filers that carve out patented uses under section viii\n  when seeking approval to market generic drug products, in\n  direct contravention of the Hatch-Waxman Act. Amici cu-\n  riae raised concerns about lack of clarity of our decision\n  when the patented uses are carved out of the FDA-\n  approved label. On February 9, 2021, we granted the peti-\n  tion for panel rehearing, vacated the October 2, 2020 judg-\n  ment, and withdrew the October 2, 2020 opinions.\n       Amici were concerned that our prior decision could be\n  read to upset the careful balance struck with section viii\n  carve-outs. The Novartis Brief explained, \u201cGenerics could\n  be held liable for actively inducing infringement if they\n  marketed a drug with a label describing a patented thera-\n  peutic use or if they took active steps to encourage doctors\n  or patients to use the drug in an infringing manner. But\n  generics could not be held liable for merely marketing and\n  selling under a \u2018skinny\u2019 label omitting all patented indica-\n  tions, or for merely noting (without mentioning any infring-\n  ing uses) that FDA had rated a product as therapeutically\n  equivalent to a brand-name drug.\u201d Novartis Br. at 1\u20132. We\n  agree that Novartis accurately stated the law, and we\n  agreed to rehear this case to make clear how the facts of\n  this case place it clearly outside the boundaries of the con-\n  cerns expressed by amici. As this record reflects, in both\n  time periods, substantial evidence supports that Teva ac-\n  tively induced by marketing a drug with a label encourag-\n  ing a patented therapeutic use. They did not \u201comit[] all\n  patented indications\u201d or \u201cmerely note[] (without mention-\n  ing any infringing uses) that FDA had rated a product as\n  therapeutically equivalent to a brand-name drug.\u201d Novar-\n  tis Br. at 1\u20132. This is a case in which substantial evidence\n  supports a jury finding that the patented use was on the\n  generic label at all relevant times and that, therefore, Teva\n  failed to carve out all patented indications.

Here, how-\n  ever, as discussed above, Dr. McCullough marched through\n  Teva\u2019s label explaining how it met the limitations of claim\n  1. Unlike the absence of information in the label of Bayer\n  Schering, Dr. McCullough provided testimony that Teva\u2019s\n  partial label instructed the claimed treatment and use.\n       Teva never genuinely challenged Dr. McCullough\u2019s tes-\n  timony regarding the contents of Teva\u2019s partial label. Teva\n  cites portions of Dr. Zusman\u2019s testimony as purporting to\n  contradict that the post-MI LVD indication means treating\n  heart failure.

According to Teva, when its generic\n  carvedilol is used to treat patients without symptomatic\n  heart failure, there is no infringement, and thus, the label\u2019s\n  recommended use on both types of patients somehow obvi-\n  ates infringement. We do not find this argument persua-\n  sive, and neither of the cases cited by Teva is analogous to\n  these facts.\n      In HZNP, the claimed method of use required three\n  steps: applying a topical medication, waiting for the\n  treated area to dry, and then applying a second topical\n  product. 940 F.3d at 702. Actavis\u2019 generic label, however,\n  only required the first applying step. The district court ex-\n  amined the label and held, at summary judgment, it did\n  not induce the claimed use. Id. We agreed given the lack\n  of evidence that the label encouraged, recommended, or\n  promoted users to perform two of the three claimed steps.\n  Id. In contrast, substantial evidence in this case supports\n  the jury\u2019s determination that Teva\u2019s partial label contained\n  information encouraging each claimed step and the pream-\n  ble. Dr. McCullough\u2019s testimony that the partial label met\n  each claim limitation and represented to doctors that the\n  treatment decreased mortality caused by CHF supports the\n  jury\u2019s finding.

TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n       In Grunenthal, the claimed method of use was treating\n  polyneuropathic pain. 919 F.3d at 1336. The defendants\n  filed section viii statements carving out treatment of dia-\n  betic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), a type of polyneuro-\n  pathic pain. Id. at 1339. The generic labels nonetheless\n  maintained an indication to broadly treat severe pain re-\n  quiring around-the-clock treatment. Yet evidence sup-\n  ported that this severe pain would not necessarily be\n  polyneuropathic, but could also be mononeuropathic or no-\n  ciceptive. Id. In that case, the district court made a factual\n  determination that this label did not instruct the claimed\n  method. We found no clear error in the district court\u2019s find-\n  ing of no inducement because the generic labels did not\n  \u201cimplicitly or explicitly encourage or instruct users to take\n  action that would inevitably lead to . . . treatment of poly-\n  neuropathic pain.\u201d Id. at 1340. 3 Here, a jury found induce-\n  ment. The combination of Teva\u2019s partial label, Dr.\n  McCullough\u2019s element-by-element testimony that the par-\n  tial label explicitly instructs administering carvedilol for\n  the claimed use of decreasing mortality caused by CHF,\n  and Dr. Zusman\u2019s admission that the post-MI LVD indica-\n  tion falls within the definition of congestive heart failure is\n  substantial evidence that supports the jury\u2019s finding.\n      Critically, the district court erred by treating this fact\n  question\u2014whether the post-MI LVD indication instructs a\n  physician to prescribe carvedilol for a claimed use\u2014as\n  though it were a legal one for it to decide de novo. In a\n  footnote of the district court\u2019s JMOL decision, it decided the\n  post-MI LVD portion of Teva\u2019s label was insufficient to find\n  that the label instructed an infringing use. Dist.

The district court erred at JMOL by making a fact\n\n\n\n      3   Moreover, in contrast to this case, we recognized in\n  Grunenthal that the partial label was the only evidence of\n  inducement and that we could not conclude on those facts\n  that the district court clearly erred.\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187       Page: 19     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v.

Teva argues that GSK\u2019s submissions\n  to the FDA for Orange Book listing associated with the \u2019000\n  patent is such evidence. If a new drug application (NDA)\n  has already been approved when the applicant obtains a\n  patent, the applicant must notify the FDA of such patent\n  within 30 days of it issuing. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.53(c)(2)(ii).\n  Under penalty of perjury, GSK submitted information for\n  the \u2019000 patent, which issued after carvedilol was FDA-\n  approved, declaring it claimed a method of use for carve-\n  dilol. J.A. 6880\u201387 (Form FDA 3542). GSK was required\n  in part 4.2a of its declaration to \u201cidentify the use with spe-\n  cific reference to the approved labeling for the drug prod-\n  uct.\u201d J.A. 6881. It listed: \u201ctreatment of mild-to-severe\n  heart failure of ischemic or cardiomyopathic origin, usually\n  in addition to diuretics, ACE inhibitor, and digitalis, to in-\n  crease survival.\u201d Id. GSK did not mention the post-MI\n  LVD indication in this submission to the FDA. This,\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 20     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  20 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  however, does not appear to be the information listed in the\n  Orange Book.\n      The FDA further required, in part 4.2b of the Form,\n  that GSK \u201c[s]ubmit the description of the approved indica-\n  tion or method of use that [it] propose[d] FDA include as\n  the \u2018Use Code\u2019 in the Orange Book.\u201d J.A. 6882. GSK an-\n  swered: \u201cDecreasing Mortality Caused By Congestive\n  Heart Failure.\u201d Id. The FDA accepted that representation\n  and listed the corresponding use code in the Orange Book\n  as describing what is covered by the \u2019000 patent.\n      There are two ways in which GSK\u2019s failure to identify\n  the post-MI LVD use in its part 4.2a statement could be\n  relevant to inducement in this case. First, that failure is\n  relevant to whether the post-MI LVD use infringes. Sec-\n  ond, at least for the partial label period, that failure is rel-\n  evant to intent to induce infringement. 4 On both points,\n  the jury decided against Teva.\n      As Teva acknowledged, GSK\u2019s submissions to the FDA\n  are \u201cnot absolutely dispositive of infringement.\u201d See Glax-\n  oSmithKline LLC v.

It\u2019s correct that FDA said the statement you just\n      had up there. I guess it\u2019s gone now, where FDA\n      provides a statement to that effect. That is correct.\n  Trial Tr. at 1057:13\u20131058:10. Both FDA experts agreed\n  that the FDA plays no role in determining patent infringe-\n  ment. The jury heard this evidence and the evidence dis-\n  cussed above as to GSK\u2019s claim that the post-MI LVD\n  indication infringed the \u2019000 patent. Thus, substantial ev-\n  idence supports the jury\u2019s finding that the post-MI LVD in-\n  dication infringed the \u2019000 patent.\n       At oral argument on rehearing, Teva suggested that\n  GSK\u2019s FDA submission for the Orange Book listing for the\n  \u2019000 patent, which according to Teva is at odds with GSK\u2019s\n  infringement allegations, creates equitable estoppel. See\n  Oral Arg. at 53:56\u201355:28. There are serious consequences\n  for filing false or incomplete information to the FDA. See\n  id. at 55:28\u201356:04 (Teva explaining the consequences in-\n  cluding rejection of the NDA); see also 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (it\n  is a criminal act to file a false declaration under penalty of\n  perjury). Teva argues one such consequence ought to be\n  equitable estoppel, which should preclude GSK\u2019s assertion\n  of the \u2019000 patent against Teva at least as to the post-MI\n  LVD use. GSK\u2019s representations regarding the Orange\n  Book listing of the \u2019000 patent, Teva\u2019s reliance, and fairness\n  go directly to an equitable estoppel defense, which has not\n  yet been tried to the district court. The district court\n  acknowledged that Teva raised this defense, but decided\n  that it was \u201creserved to be tried to the Court at a later\n  date.\u201d J.A. 29.\n       There are factual disputes regarding the estoppel issue\n  that the district court has not yet had an opportunity to\n  decide. For example, GSK argued on appeal that the use\n  code that was listed in the Orange Book\u2014\u201cdecreasing mor-\n  tality caused by congestive heart failure\u201d\u2014covers all heart\n  failure patients including post-MI LVD patients and that\n  Teva\u2019s assertion that the use code covers only the CHF\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 23     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      23\n\n\n\n  indication is wrong. GSK Resp. and Reply Br. at 30. GSK\n  further argues that \u201cthe use code is not tied to any partic-\n  ular indication, and the FDA tells generics that the use\n  code \u2018is not meant to substitute for the applicant\u2019s review\n  of the patent and the approved labeling.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting 68\n  Fed. Reg. at 36,683). And Dr. McCullough testified that\n  the post-MI LVD indication satisfied the first claim limita-\n  tion, i.e., decreasing mortality caused by congestive heart\n  failure. J.A. 10623:6\u201310623:23. It is also not clear from\n  this record whether Teva had access to GSK\u2019s declaration\n  (which was marked confidential and is not included in the\n  Orange Book). Teva responds that it modified the label ex-\n  actly as the FDA instructed it to in accordance with the\n  GSK-provided use code. See J.A. 6908\u201310 (FDA mark-up\n  of Teva label). As acknowledged above, Teva\u2019s own FDA\n  expert, Mr. Karst, explained that an ANDA filer must per-\n  form its own analysis for patent infringement purposes.\n  Trial Tr. at 1057:13\u20131058:10 (testimony of Mr. Karst). Is-\n  sues of fact remain as to GSK\u2019s representations and Teva\u2019s\n  reliance on those representations that have been \u201creserved\n  to be tried\u201d by the district court. J.A. 29.\n      The dissent proposes that this court leapfrog that nor-\n  mal process and resolve these questions of law, equity, and\n  fact on appeal without any trial. We decline to do so. The\n  dissent claims it is not focused on estoppel, but rather on\n  whether \u201cthe law\u201d permits an inference of intent from a la-\n  bel in light of GSK\u2019s representations to the FDA. See Dis.\n  at 19. The dissent would hold that GSK\u2019s representations\n  to the FDA in its declaration bar a finding of intent by the\n  jury as a matter of law regardless of the remainder of the\n  record. But intent is itself a question of fact, and this rec-\n  ord contained substantial evidence from which the jury\n  could find Teva intended to infringe despite GSK\u2019s repre-\n  sentation to the FDA. This rule of law the dissent seeks is\n  exactly the estoppel case made by Teva, which the district\n  court has yet to try.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 24    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  24 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n      The issues before us are the issues that were tried to\n  the jury and decided in the district court. We conclude sub-\n  stantial evidence supports the finding that Teva\u2019s partial\n  label was evidence Teva instructed physicians to use its\n  carvedilol in an infringing way. Dr. McCullough explained\n  where Teva\u2019s partial label met each claim limitation and\n  discussed other materials that would lead physicians to the\n  partial label, culminating with his conclusion that Teva\n  took action that it \u201cintended would encourage or assist ac-\n  tions by another, i.e., the physician.\u201d J.A. 10644:15\u201319.\n  Dr. McCullough did not testify that Teva\u2019s actions merely\n  describe infringement; he testified that Teva\u2019s actions en-\n  couraged infringement.\n      The dissent\u2019s suggestion that there were only three\n  pieces of evidence (the partial label plus the two press re-\n  leases) on which the jury could have relied to find intent is\n  equally inaccurate. The jury received Teva\u2019s partial label,\n  extensive expert testimony, Teva\u2019s product catalogs, Teva\u2019s\n  advertising and promotional activities, Teva\u2019s Monthly\n  Prescribing References for doctors, and testimony from\n  Teva\u2019s own company witnesses, all of which the jury could\n  have relied on to find Teva intended to encourage, recom-\n  mend, or promote infringement.\n      As the Supreme Court explained in Grokster:\n      Evidence of active steps taken to encourage direct\n      infringement such as advertising an infringing use\n      or instructing how to engage in an infringing use,\n      show an affirmative intent that the product be used\n      to infringe, and a showing that infringement was\n      encouraged overcomes the law\u2019s reluctance to find\n      liability when a defendant merely sells a commer-\n      cial product suitable for some lawful use.\n  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v.

TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n       We assume, as we must, that the jury found the post-\n  MI LVD use infringes the \u2019000 patent, and that Teva\u2019s label\n  contained instructions encouraging prescribing carvedilol\n  in a manner that infringes the \u2019000 patent. Throughout,\n  the dissent claims that there was not substantial evidence\n  upon which the jury could conclude that Teva\u2019s label would\n  encourage doctors to prescribe Teva\u2019s carvedilol for the la-\n  beled uses. That is because, according to Teva (and the dis-\n  sent), there is no evidence that doctors read labels or\n  prescribe according to those labels. But the jury was pre-\n  sented expert testimony from Dr. McCullough (GSK\u2019s ex-\n  pert), from Dr. Zusman (Teva\u2019s expert), and from Teva\u2019s\n  own documents to the contrary. First, Dr. McCullough tes-\n  tified that doctors do read labels. See J.A. 10612:7\u20139 (\u201cQ.\n  Two, that doctors don\u2019t read labels? Do you agree that that\n  is the case? A. No, I disagree with that.\u201d). Second, Teva\u2019s\n  own Monthly Prescribing References, which were \u201cin-\n  tended solely for use by the medical professional,\u201d ex-\n  plained that \u201c[t]he clinician must be familiar with the full\n  product labeling provided by the manufacturer or distribu-\n  tor of the drug, of every product he or she prescribes, as\n  well as the relevant medical literature.\u201d J.A. 6196 (Teva\u2019s\n  2012 Monthly Prescribing Reference); see also J.A.\n  10611:19\u201325 (Dr. McCullough); Trial Tr. at 1253:15\u201323,\n  1254:23\u20131255:9 (Dr. Zusman agreeing that Teva\u2019s MPR in-\n  dicates that the MPR \u201chas been produced to provide an eas-\n  ily accessible reminder of basic information useful to\n  review when prescribing medications\u201d and that physicians\n  should verify any questions against the labelling). In other\n  words, the literature Teva provided to doctors told them to\n  read labels and to prescribe according to them. While\n  Teva\u2019s Monthly Prescribing References were published\n  during the full label period, they powerfully refute Teva\u2019s\n  claim that doctors do not and need not read labels in\n\n\n  how, and to reject the dissent\u2019s claim that the label de-\n  scribes rather than instructs as to an infringing use.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 27     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v.

Teva\u2019s own\n  Monthly Prescribing References merely confirm the quite\n  logical proposition that doctors read labels and that the la-\n  bels are intended to affect prescribing decisions. We cannot\n  conclude that it would be unreasonable for the jury to think\n  that, in 2007 or 2011, Teva believed doctors did not and\n  need not read labels and only then wisened to the idea in\n  2012. In fact, Teva\u2019s own Director of National Accounts,\n  Mr. Rekenthaler, testified to his belief that doctors would\n  prescribe carvedilol according to the package insert (the la-\n  bel). Trial Tr. at 590:15\u201317 (\u201cI guess my expectation is, like\n  any drug, that it would be used as detailed in the package\n  insert.\u201d); <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"211890\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/211890\/arthrocare-corp-v-smith-nephew-inc\/\">id. at 592:5<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">\u20138 (\u201cI mean my assumption would be,\n  unless something specific was brought up, that it would be\n  used, that the physicians would use it as they should use\n  it, again which is detailed in our insert.\u201d).\n      This is record evidence that Teva intended its label to\n  affect physician\u2019s prescribing practices, and the jury was\n  entitled, as our caselaw has repeatedly held, to rely upon\n  that to determine Teva\u2019s intent. But it is not the only evi-\n  dence.\n      GSK also presented extensive expert testimony along\n  with Teva\u2019s marketing efforts, catalogs, press releases, and\n  testimony from Teva\u2019s own witnesses, showing that Teva\n  encouraged carvedilol sales for CHF despite its attempted\n  carve-out. This is evidence supporting the jury\u2019s finding\n  that Teva induced infringement.\n      The jury was presented with evidence of Teva\u2019s mar-\n  keting materials. Teva\u2019s Spring 2008 and Spring 2009\n  Product Catalogs described Teva\u2019s carvedilol as an\n  AB rated therapeutic equivalent to Coreg\u00ae. J.A. 6221,\n  6270. Teva and amici agree that an AB rating means the\n  generic product is therapeutically equivalent to the brand\n  product under the conditions specified in the generic\u2019s la-\n  bel. As explained above, substantial evidence supports the\n  jury\u2019s presumed conclusion that the partial label\u2019s\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 28    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  28 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  indication for post-MI LVD did not effectively carve out the\n  use claimed in the \u2019000 patent. Thus, Teva\u2019s AB rated rep-\n  resentations under these limited circumstances, when sub-\n  stantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s presumed\n  determination regarding the label\u2019s contents, are further\n  affirmative evidence supporting the jury\u2019s inducement\n  finding. 7\n      GSK also presented evidence that, prior to the \u2019000 pa-\n  tent\u2019s issuance, Teva issued two relevant press releases:\n  one in 2004 and another in 2007. In its 2004 press release,\n  Teva announced that the FDA granted it \u201ctentative ap-\n  proval\u201d for its carvedilol tablets, with final approval \u201cantic-\n  ipated upon expiry of patent protection for the brand\n  product on March 5, 2007.\u201d J.A. 6347. It noted its \u201cCarve-\n  dilol Tablets are the AB rated generic equivalent of Glax-\n  oSmithKline\u2019s Coreg\u00ae Tablets and are indicated for\n  treatment of heart failure and hypertension.\u201d <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"211890\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/211890\/arthrocare-corp-v-smith-nephew-inc\/\">Id.<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\"> (emphasis\n  added). The dissent suggests that Teva\u2019s \u201creference to\n  heart failure\u201d is not evidence that supports the jury\u2019s find-\n  ing that Teva intended to encourage infringement of GSK\u2019s\n  claimed method. The entire purpose of this press release\n  is to announce its approval as a substitute for GSK\u2019s\n  Coreg\u00ae Tablets, and it expressly says that the Teva generic\n  \u201ctablets are the AB-rated generic equivalent of Glax-\n  oSmithKline\u2019s Coreg\u00ae Tablets and are indicated for treat-\n  ment of heart failure and hypertension.\u201d J.A. 6347. The\n  press release\u2019s use of \u201cheart failure\u201d does not parse between\n  congestive heart failure or post-MI LVD. This is not an\n\n\n\n      7    We do not hold that an AB rating in a true section\n  viii carve-out (one in which a label was produced that had\n  no infringing indications) would be evidence of inducement.\n  In this case, Teva\u2019s representation of AB rating would point\n  physicians to its partial label, which, for the reasons above,\n  the jury was free to credit as evidence of induced infringe-\n  ment.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 29     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v.

The dissent criticizes our analy-\n  sis, claiming that we have weakened intentional\n  encouragement because \u201csimply calling a product a \u2018generic\n  version\u2019 or \u2018generic equivalent\u2019\u2014is now enough.\u201d Dis. at\n  34\u201335. That is not our holding or the facts.\n      Though the dissent seems to think the press release is\n  not evidence of encouragement, it seems self-evident that a\n  jury could conclude that Teva\u2019s intent in issuing a press re-\n  lease telling the world it could use Teva\u2019s tablets as a sub-\n  stitute for GSK\u2019s Coreg\u00ae tablets to treat congestive heart\n  failure was to encourage that use.            Moreover, Dr.\n  McCullough testified that he saw the 2004 press release\n  and that it indicates physicians should prescribe generic\n  carvedilol for heart failure. J.A. 11656:1\u201310; J.A. 11657:6\u2013\n  10 (testifying that Teva\u2019s press release informed doctors\n  that \u201cit certainly should be\u201d prescribed for the treatment of\n  heart failure); J.A. 11659:11\u201319 (Teva\u2019s press release indi-\n  cates that doctors should be able to prescribe generic car-\n  vedilol for heart failure). Dr. McCullough also testified\n  that doctors consider press releases so they \u201cknow when\n  drugs are going generic.\u201d J.A. 11655:9\u201324.\n      Teva issued a second press release in 2007 in which it\n  stated that it had received final approval \u201cto market its Ge-\n  neric version of GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s cardiovascular agent\n  Coreg\u00ae (Carvedilol) Tablets.\u201d J.A. 6353.

Yes.\u201d (emphasis added)) (Dr. McCullough dis-\n  cussing the impact of the press releases on doctors). On\n  appeal, we review the jury\u2019s verdict for substantial evi-\n  dence based upon the record; we cannot hunt outside the\n  record to find evidence to try to contradict the verdict. The\n  dissent claims there is no intentional encouragement be-\n  cause the word cardiovascular is \u201c[a] well-understood ad-\n  jective\u201d that means \u201crelating to the heart,\u201d and as such\n  Teva\u2019s press release could simply be read to encourage use\n  for non-patented heart related conditions. Dis. at 23.\n  First, the dissent goes outside the record to make up this\n  definition, something the district court explicitly told the\n  jury it could not do. See Trial Tr. at 264 (\u201cDuring the course\n  of the trial, you must not conduct any independent re-\n  search about the case . . . . In other words, you should not\n  consult dictionaries or reference materials.\u201d). Second,\n  there was actual testimony in the record about how the\n  word cardiovascular in this press release would be under-\n  stood by skilled artisans. See J.A. 11660:3\u201313 (McCullough\n  testifying that a skilled artisan would understand the word\n  cardiovascular in this press release to indicate that the ge-\n  neric could be used for all indications including heart fail-\n  ure). Third, Teva did not merely say its drug is a\n  cardiovascular agent, leaving the world to wonder about its\n  uses. It said its product is a generic equivalent of GSK\u2019s\n  cardiovascular agent Coreg\u00ae. It was reasonable for the jury\n  to conclude, especially in light of the prior press release\n  that expressly mentioned heart failure, that Teva was\n  again encouraging the substitution of its product for all of\n  Coreg\u2019s\u00ae cardiovascular indications, including as claimed\n  in the \u2019000 patent.\n      We have acknowledged that, as a matter of law, affirm-\n  ative acts taken before a patent issues cannot violate\n  \u00a7 271(b).

Substantial evidence sup-\n  ports the jury\u2019s verdict that Teva induced infringement.\n                                C\n      GSK presented evidence that Teva\u2019s partial label did\n  not successfully carve out the patented use, and thus, Teva\n  was selling its generic with a label which infringed the\n  method claim. GSK presented evidence that doctors read\n  and consider labels, that Teva\u2019s marketing materials\n  guided doctors to the label and to its website promoting the\n  patented use, that Teva issued press releases encouraging\n  doctors to prescribe carvedilol for the patented use, that\n  Teva\u2019s own employees expected doctors to prescribe carve-\n  dilol during the partial label period for the patented uses,\n  and expert testimony that Teva\u2019s actions encouraged doc-\n  tors to do so.

At the\n  time, however, it still had a patent on one of carvedilol\u2019s\n  three FDA-approved uses. Because the FDA cannot au-\n  thorize a generic version of a drug that would infringe a\n  patent, this one remaining patented use could have pre-\n  vented a less-expensive, generic carvedilol from coming to\n  market altogether\u2014even though the drug itself and other\n  uses of it were unpatented. Congress saw this problem\n  coming. It wanted to make sure that one patented use\n  wouldn\u2019t prevent public access to a generic version of a\n  drug that also has unpatented uses. See Caraco Pharm.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 42     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  2   GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n\n  Labs. Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A\/S, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728300\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/728300\/caraco-pharmaceutical-laboratories-ltd-v-novo-nordisk-as\/\">566 U.S. 399<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 415 (2012).\n  So it created rules for just this situation.\n       These rules, embodied in the so-called skinny-label pro-\n  visions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, are straightforward. If\n  a brand drug company (here, GSK) has a patent on one of\n  a drug\u2019s uses, it tells the FDA which use is patented. In\n  fact, it tells the FDA exactly what language from its label\n  is covered by its patents. The FDA will then permit a ge-\n  neric version of that drug to come to market if the manu-\n  facturer \u201ccarves out\u201d such use from its drug label by\n  omitting the language that the brand drug company iden-\n  tified. That\u2019s what happened here. GSK\u2019s sworn FDA fil-\n  ings identified just one use as patented. So Teva carved\n  out that use and came to market with its \u201cskinny\u201d label. It\n  played by the rules, exactly as Congress intended. It sold\n  its generic for years without controversy.\n       And then, in the seventh year, GSK finally sued. It al-\n  leged that, even though Teva\u2019s skinny label carved out the\n  very use\u2014indeed, the only use\u2014that GSK said was pa-\n  tented, the label showed that Teva intended to encourage\n  an infringing use. GSK also supported its inducement case\n  by pointing to two cursory, pre-patent press releases that\n  announced Teva\u2019s drug\u2019s approval (or \u201ctentative\u201d approval)\n  and called it the generic equivalent of GSK\u2019s brand drug\n  Coreg. The evidence of inducement\u2014i.e., that Teva had\n  culpable intent to encourage infringement and that its\n  skinny label or press releases caused doctors\u2019 prescribing\n  practices\u2014was thin to nonexistent. But a jury found Teva\n  liable all the same. This sometimes happens. And when it\n  does, there is a remedy: a court will reverse a jury\u2019s verdict\n  if there is insufficient evidence to support it. The experi-\n  enced trial judge sensibly did just that.\n       The majority, now on its second try, again reinstates\n  the verdict nonetheless. Its first try prompted widespread\n  criticism concerning the troubling implications for skinny\n  labels. This effort is no better. With reasoning sometimes\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 43    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.        3\n\n\n\n  labored, sometimes opaque, the majority strains to prop up\n  a jury verdict that is unsupportable. For example, based\n  on language that remained on the skinny label after Teva\u2019s\n  carve-out, the majority finds it reasonable to infer that\n  Teva intentionally encouraged infringement. It finds this\n  reasonable even though Teva, by carving out everything\n  that GSK said would infringe, was trying to avoid having\n  its label encourage infringement. The majority then in-\n  dulges the inference that doctors, as a class, relied on\n  Teva\u2019s skinny label to infringe, even though every expert\n  cardiologist at trial said he didn\u2019t even read the label to\n  make prescribing decisions. And, most troubling, the ma-\n  jority is willing to see culpable intent behind a generic\u2019s de-\n  scribing its product as the \u201cequivalent\u201d of a brand drug\u2014in\n  a system that requires generic drugs to be equivalent, and\n  in which everyone understands that generic drugs are\n  equivalent.\n       I write in this case because far from being a disagree-\n  ment among reasonable minds about the individual facts,\n  this case signals that our law on this issue has gone awry.\n  I am particularly concerned with three aspects of the ma-\n  jority\u2019s analysis. First, even setting aside the majority\u2019s\n  willingness to glean intentional encouragement from a la-\n  bel specifically designed to avoid encouragement, the ma-\n  jority further weakens the intentional-encouragement\n  prong of inducement by effectively eliminating the demar-\n  cation between describing an infringing use and encourag-\n  ing that use in a label. Second, the majority defies basic\n  tort law by eviscerating the causation prong of inducement.\n  The upshot of these two moves is that a plaintiff now has\n  to show very little for a jury to speculate as to the rest.\n  Third, the majority creates confusion for generics, leaving\n  them in the dark about what might expose them to liabil-\n  ity. These missteps throw a wrench into Congress\u2019s design\n  for enabling quick public access to generic versions of un-\n  patented drugs with unpatented uses.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 44     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  4   GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v.

TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n\n      Often a generic wants to launch while patents remain\n  on a drug or its uses. Anticipating this, Congress provided\n  two pathways for generics to show that a proposed label\n  will not infringe.\n       The first pathway is to file a certification explaining\n  why the generic label will not infringe any patent that a\n  brand has identified to the FDA as covering the drug. The\n  commonly used \u201cparagraph IV\u201d certification states that a\n  generic label will not infringe because the patent \u201cis invalid\n  or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of\n  the [generic] drug.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). Para-\n  graph IV often prompts litigation. If a generic, armed with\n  a good-faith paragraph IV argument, files an ANDA with a\n  brand\u2019s full label, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows the brand\n  to sue and entitles it to an automatic 30-month stay of final\n  FDA approval of the generic drug while the underlying pa-\n  tent issues are worked out in court.

By 2007, the compound itself was no longer pa-\n  tented, nor were most uses of it.\n      Carvedilol is a beta blocker, a class of drugs used since\n  the 1960s to treat heart conditions. Carvedilol in particu-\n  lar was developed in the 1980s and was covered by U.S.\n  Patent No. 4,503,067, which issued in 1985 and claimed\n  the compound itself.\n      By the early 1990s, research from various groups re-\n  vealed that beta blockers could be useful for treating a con-\n  dition called congestive heart failure (\u201cCHF\u201d), which\n  prevents the heart from being able to deliver enough oxy-\n  genated blood to the body. By 1995, GSK had already re-\n  ceived approval for an NDA under the brand name Coreg\n  for hypertension. A supplement to that NDA added the\n  CHF indication to the label in 1997. After the approval of\n  the CHF labeling, GSK received U.S. Patent No. 5,760,069,\n  relating to a particular manner of using carvedilol with\n  other drugs to treat CHF. GSK listed the \u2019069 and\n\n\n      9    See Brief of Amici Curiae Novartis Pharmaceuti-\n  cals Corporation and Sandoz Inc. in Support of Rehearing\n  En Banc 7, ECF No. 168 (\u201cNovartis & Sandoz Br.\u201d) (\u201cBoth\n  branded and generic pharmaceutical companies require\n  stable, predictable legal environments to operate effec-\n  tively.

TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  \u2019067 patents in the Orange Book. Eventually, and well be-\n  fore any generic launched, carvedilol became the standard\n  of care for CHF. This standard was incorporated into the\n  official guidelines of the American College of Cardiology\n  and American Heart Association (as well as numerous\n  medical textbooks and journals) and taught to medical stu-\n  dents around the country.\n       As the 2007 expiration of GSK\u2019s carvedilol compound\n  patent approached, interest grew among generics. Upon\n  this expiration, generics would be able to market carvedilol\n  in one of two ways: either with an all-indications label (by\n  challenging GSK\u2019s method patent under a paragraph IV\n  certification) or by simply omitting any patented uses from\n  the label (with a section viii statement). Teva first chose\n  the former, reasoning\u2014correctly, as it turned out\u2014that\n  GSK\u2019s \u2019069 method patent was invalid. And so in mid-2002\n  Teva filed its ANDA with a proposed full label directed to\n  hypertension and CHF, certifying that it would wait for\n  GSK\u2019s compound patent to expire but that GSK\u2019s\n  \u2019069 method patent was invalid. J.A. 3003\u201319, 5463. GSK\n  did not sue or seek to block Teva\u2019s approval. Instead it\n  sought reissue of its \u2019069 patent, admitting invalidity of the\n  original and adding narrowing limitations to overcome va-\n  lidity challenges.\n       In 2003, GSK got approval to add another indication to\n  its label: post-MI LVD. 10 This entailed a discrete new set\n  of label text, with new underlying clinical studies and new\n  instructions. Teva likewise updated the label accompany-\n  ing its pending ANDA to include all three indications. In\n  2004, the FDA determined that Teva had shown its product\n\n\n\n      10  This condition concerns patients who have recently\n  suffered a heart attack (a \u201cmyocardial infarction,\u201d or \u201cMI\u201d)\n  and whose hearts have trouble pumping blood (\u201cleft ven-\n  tricular dysfunction,\u201d or \u201cLVD\u201d).\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187     Page: 51    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v.

So Teva did too,\n  informing the FDA that it now intended to carve out from\n  GSK\u2019s label the uses GSK said were patented.\n       Again, GSK\u2019s label contained three sets of instructions\n  for three distinct indications: CHF, post-MI LVD, and hy-\n  pertension:\n\n\n\n\n  J.A. 7992.

Faithful to GSK\u2019s declaration, the FDA for-\n  warded Teva a redlined label for use that omitted every-\n  thing GSK had said the \u2019069 method patent covered:\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 52    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  12 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n\n  J.A. 6913. It instructed Teva to use that label, which Teva\n  did\u2014with the same carve-out as the other seven generic\n  manufacturers that launched at that time.\n      After the generics launched, GSK\u2019s \u2019069 method patent\n  reissued as U.S. Patent No. RE40,000, the patent relevant\n  here. GSK added several narrowing limitations to the\n  \u2019000 patent to save it from invalidity. With the reissue pro-\n  cess now completed, GSK delisted its \u2019069 method patent\n  from the Orange Book and listed the \u2019000 patent in its\n  stead\u2014again submitting a sworn declaration identifying\n  only the CHF indication as covered. J.A. 6880\u201387. Con-\n  sistent with this representation, GSK did not sue the ge-\n  nerics, whose skinny labels included everything but CHF.\n      Years later in 2011, the FDA directed Teva to revise its\n  label to include the CHF indication. Teva complied. The\n  skinny-label period thus ended and the full-label period be-\n  gan. Teva did not issue a press release or otherwise notify\n  doctors of the change to its label. Indeed, Teva did not\n  change anything about how it marketed its generic\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 53    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v.

Nor in 2008 when GSK\u2019s\n  \u2019000 patent emerged from reissue. Nor even in 2011 when\n  Teva transitioned to the full label. It sued instead in 2014,\n  just before the \u2019000 patent expired.\n      The lawsuit ultimately led to a seven-day jury trial in\n  2018. The jury was asked to determine whether Teva in-\n  duced infringement of the \u2019000 patent based on the skinny-\n  label period and the full-label period separately. It found\n  that Teva induced infringement of the \u2019000 patent based on\n  both labels. It also found that GSK was entitled to\n  $234.1 million in lost profits and $1.4 million in reasona-\n  ble-royalty damages.\n       After the verdict, Teva filed a renewed motion for\n  JMOL, arguing that GSK had not presented legally suffi-\n  cient evidence to support a finding of inducement.

GSK appealed, and Teva\n  cross-appealed as to damages.\n      The case was argued to us in September 2019. In Oc-\n  tober 2020, the majority issued a first opinion reversing the\n  district court\u2019s JMOL. That opinion prompted widespread\n  consternation and confusion, as described in Teva\u2019s peti-\n  tion for rehearing and the eight amicus briefs in support.\n  Among these amici: both generics and brands, fifty-seven\n  law professors, and Congressman Waxman.

The majority now issues a second\n  opinion reaching the same result as before, but with new\n  reasoning. In particular, it now declares that this is not a\n  \u201ctrue\u201d skinny-label case. E.g., Maj. 10\u201311, 28 n.7. But this\n  remains a skinny-label case, the record remains the record,\n  and inducement liability remains unsupportable.\n                         II.

Part C addresses\n  more broadly why the majority\u2019s analysis has troubling im-\n  plications for skinny labels and inducement law generally.\n                  A. The Skinny-Label Period\n       For the skinny-label period\u2014that is, from Teva\u2019s\n  skinny-label launch in 2007 to its full-label amendment in\n  2011\u2014the majority relies on three key pieces of evidence to\n  conclude that substantial evidence supports the verdict:\n  the skinny label itself (in particular, the post-MI LVD in-\n  dication on that label) and two press releases distributed\n  before the \u2019000 patent issued\u2014one from 2007, another from\n  2004. I discuss each in turn, followed by the majority\u2019s sup-\n  posedly substantial other evidence of intent. From them,\n  alone or combined, no reasonable jury could have found\n  (1) culpable intent to encourage infringement or (2) causa-\n  tion, much less both.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 56    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  16 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n                  1. The Skinny Label Itself\n      Before discussing what the skinny label said, recall\n  what it didn\u2019t say\u2014and why. The label omitted the CHF\n  indication (and only the CHF indication) because GSK\u2019s\n  sworn FDA filings asserted patent coverage of the CHF in-\n  dication (and only the CHF indication). Analogizing to a\n  typical patent case, it\u2019s as though Teva had drafted a po-\n  tentially infringing user manual and then, abiding by the\n  patentee\u2019s clear guidance, deleted all the pages that might\n  be viewed as encouraging infringement of a patented\n  method. Ironically, everything about this process signals\n  that, far from intending to encourage infringement, Teva\n  very much intended not to encourage infringement with its\n  skinny label.\n      Of course, this will likely be true of most generics that\n  get approved via the Hatch-Waxman section viii skinny-la-\n  bel pathway. Indeed, inferring intentional encouragement\n  to infringe a method\u2014from a label that has intentionally\n  omitted everything that the brand said covers that\n  method\u2014is a lot to ask of a reasonable factfinder. Only\n  once has this court upheld an inducement finding involving\n  a putative skinny label, and that case had a crucial, addi-\n  tional fact: the generic knew it had an infringement prob-\n  lem. AstraZeneca LP v. Apotex, Inc., <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"178456\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/178456\/astrazeneca-lp-v-apotex-inc\/\">633 F.3d 1042<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1060\n  (Fed.

By contrast, GSK put on no similar evidence here.\n  Indeed, the facts surrounding Teva\u2019s skinny label are sim-\n  ple and undisputed.\n      The majority nonetheless manufactures a factual dis-\n  pute, all on its own. It surmises that: maybe, just maybe,\n  GSK\u2019s declarations were confidential, hidden from Teva\u2019s\n  view\u2014the implication being that Teva couldn\u2019t have relied\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 57    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.     17\n\n\n\n  on them. 11 Maj. 23. Of course, GSK itself has never made\n  this argument, despite having every incentive to do so\n  (given how Teva featured the declarations and their signif-\n  icance to the jury, the district court, and this court). It\u2019s\n  easy to guess why: the FDA confirms that the declarations\n  are available to the public. 68 Fed. Reg. at 36,683.\n      At any rate, the majority\u2019s confidentiality conjecture is\n  a red herring. Even if it were true that Teva never laid\n  eyes on GSK\u2019s exact documents, it wouldn\u2019t matter. As no\n  one disputes, Teva asked to carve out GSK\u2019s patented uses,\n  and the FDA in return used GSK\u2019s representations to pro-\n  vide Teva with a carved-out label. The FDA itself took no\n  non-infringement position; GSK did. And so by accepting\n  the FDA-provided skinny label, which hewed to GSK\u2019s pa-\n  tent declarations, Teva relied on GSK\u2019s representations of\n  patent scope. 12 See, e.g., Cross-Appellant\u2019s Br. 12\u201313,\n  51\u201352; J.A. 12475 (Teva\u2019s JMOL motion).\n\n\n\n      11  The suggestion appears to be based on the word\n  \u201cconfidential\u201d at the bottom of the declarations\u2019 pages in\n  our appendix. See Maj. 23. The majority\u2019s reliance on this\n  branding seems misplaced. Among documents similarly\n  branded \u201cconfidential\u201d: (1) the American College of Cardi-\n  ology\/American Heart Association Guidelines, published in\n  the Journal of American College of Cardiology, J.A. 3245;\n  and (2) Teva\u2019s 2012 Monthly Prescribing Reference,\n  J.A. 6192, a circulation that the majority says doctors re-\n  ceived \u201con a regular basis,\u201d Maj. 33 (quoting\n  J.A. 10607\u201308).\n      12  To that end, the declarations also belie GSK\u2019s in-\n  sistence that the 240-character use code was \u201cnot tied to\n  any particular indication.\u201d See Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 30.\n  GSK submitted a patent declaration identifying only one\n  indication. E.g., J.A. 6895. From that declaration came\n  the use code. GSK\u2019s use-code argument is therefore wrong\n  as a matter of law here. And regardless, GSK\u2019s problem\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 58    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  18 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n      Everything that follows must be assessed against the\n  carve-out backdrop. With that in mind, I turn to what re-\n  mained of the label after it was carved out. For a drug label\n  to induce, it must \u201cencourage, recommend, or promote in-\n  fringement.\u201d Takeda, 785 F.3d at 631. \u201cMerely describing\n  an infringing use\u201d in a label \u201cwill not suffice.\u201d HZNP Meds.\n  LLC v. Actavis Labs. UT, Inc., <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">940 F.3d 680<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 702 (Fed. Cir.\n  2019); Takeda, 785 F.3d at 631.\n      The majority supports the verdict with GSK\u2019s expert\n  testimony concerning the post-MI LVD indication. Again,\n  this indication remained on the label because GSK\u2019s sworn\n  declarations never said it was patented. Dr. McCullough\n  did walk through claim 1 of the \u2019000 patent and compare\n  each limitation to somewhere on the skinny label.\n  Maj. 14\u201316 (citing testimony at J.A. 10623\u201331). But he\n  never testified that the skinny label encouraged, recom-\n  mended, or promoted practicing the claimed method. 13\n\n\n\n  remains part 4.2a of the declarations, which required GSK\n  to \u201c[s]ubmit indication or method of use information as\n  identified specifically in the approved labeling.\u201d E.g.,\n  J.A. 6895 (emphasis added).\n      13   The majority suggests otherwise, via a misleading\n  cite to a snippet of testimony. See Maj. 24 (citing\n  J.A. 10644). While Dr. McCullough did testify that Teva\n  \u201ctook action\u201d intended to encourage, none of the evidence\n  he was referencing included the skinny label itself. His\n  earlier skinny-label testimony concerned underlying direct\n  infringement. E.g., J.A. 10631. But after moving to the\n  intent element of inducement, where the majority finds this\n  testimony, the label did not come up again\u2014neither di-\n  rectly nor indirectly. J.A. 10634\u201344. This may explain why\n  GSK never cited this testimony to show that the skinny la-\n  bel encouraged. Had GSK done so, Teva would have had\n  an opportunity to contest the characterization the majority\n  now adopts.\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 59    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.       19\n\n\n\n  Rather, in response to a series of questions about whether\n  certain portions of the label \u201cmet\u201d the claim limitations, he\n  testified that some limitations were met (or \u201cmentioned\u201d)\n  in the Indications and Usage section, others in the Dosage\n  and Administration section, and still others in the Clinical\n  Studies section. J.A. 10623\u201331. At most, a reasonable jury\n  could have found that the skinny label described the in-\n  fringing use (if pieced together just right), in the context of\n  post-MI LVD patients. Describing is not enough.\n      This failure of proof alone should end the intentional-\n  encouragement inquiry as to the skinny label here. But\n  when we also consider the backdrop as to how the skinny\n  label arose\u2014i.e., that Teva took out the only indication\n  GSK said was patented\u2014the lack of inducement based on\n  this label is beyond dispute. See Vita-Mix Corp. v. Basic\n  Holding, Inc., <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"208034\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/208034\/vita-mix-corp-v-basic-holding-inc\/\">581 F.3d 1317<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1329 n.2 (Fed.

TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n      All of that is just the intentional-encouragement prong\n  though; GSK also had to show causation. At a minimum,\n  it had to prove that doctors would have read the skinny la-\n  bel, then pieced together the disparate portions just like\n  Dr. McCullough did at trial, then viewed that pieced-to-\n  gether description as an encouragement to prescribe carve-\n  dilol for CHF according to the specific limitations of the\n  claimed method, and then relied on that pieced-together\n  message to make that prescribing decision.\n      Dr. McCullough certainly didn\u2019t connect these dots. In-\n  deed, he would have been a poor choice for that task. A\n  question arose at trial as to whether he had even read the\n  label before making his prescribing decisions. To survive a\n  pre-verdict JMOL motion on causation, GSK\u2019s counsel\n  promised the trial judge that if given another chance,\n  Dr. McCullough would \u201cabsolutely\u201d testify that he did so.\n  J.A. 10959; see also J.A. 10959 (counsel insisting that \u201cob-\n  viously, he always reads the label\u201d). But when given the\n  chance, he testified that no, he didn\u2019t read the label before\n  making his prescribing decisions. J.A. 11662\u201363. Not that\n  Dr. McCullough was alone in this regard; the other two ex-\n  pert cardiologists at trial testified that they didn\u2019t do so ei-\n  ther.     J.A. 11151 (Dr. Zusman); J.A. 11296\u201397\n  (Dr. Rosendorff).\n      Nothing else connected these dots.

Evidence from both sides\n  also showed that pharmacies substituted generics for the\n  brand version automatically, as all fifty states allow or\n  even require.

The majority, however, disregards this un-\n  controverted, direct evidence of causation in favor of letting\n  unsupported inferences bridge GSK\u2019s evidentiary gap. It\n  starts with the label\u2019s contents and that they were perhaps\n  \u201cread\u201d\u2014then ends up at causation. Maj. 35\u201336.

The majority confines its reliance\n  on the skinny label to the post-MI LVD indication. In par-\n  ticular, its skinny-label inducement path starts with \u201cen-\n  couragement\u201d from the post-MI LVD indication, and ends\n  in direct infringement when a doctor prescribes carvedilol\n  for any post-MI LVD patient who also happens to have\n  CHF (assuming that the rest of the claim limitations are\n  met when so prescribing). See Maj. 13\u201316, 18\u201319. Notably,\n  however, as both sides acknowledge, the damages award in\n  this case was not confined to just the appropriate subset of\n  infringing prescriptions to post-MI LVD patients who also\n  had CHF\u2014it encompassed CHF patients more broadly.\n  Cross-Appellant\u2019s Br. 54; see Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 31\u201332.\n  GSK\u2019s damages testimony was not predicated on, nor did it\n  quantify, the subset of uses that would infringe under the\n  majority\u2019s skinny-label-based inducement theory.\n      Recognizing the problem, GSK leans on the press re-\n  leases to save the full damages award; it says they\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 62    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  22 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  \u201cencouraged the infringing use for all . . . symptomatic\n  heart failure patients.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 31. But, as I\n  explain below, that\u2019s far too much weight for these press\n  releases to bear. Accordingly, even if the majority\u2019s uphold-\n  ing the verdict on the basis of the skinny label were appro-\n  priate, we would have to remand this case for a proper\n  damages calculation. But Teva\u2019s argument on this im-\n  portant issue goes unacknowledged in the majority\u2019s opin-\n  ion.\n                   2. The 2007 Press Release\n      Beyond the skinny label itself, the majority also sup-\n  ports the verdict with a 2007 Teva press release that an-\n  nounced final FDA approval for Teva to market its\n  \u201c[g]eneric version of [GSK\u2019s] cardiovascular agent Coreg\u00ae\n  (Carvedilol) Tablets.\u201d Maj. 29 (citing J.A. 6353). From this\n  press release\u2014which was distributed before the \u2019000 pa-\n  tent issued but apparently appeared on Teva\u2019s website dur-\n  ing the patent\u2019s term\u2014the majority permits inferences of\n  intentional encouragement and causation. Neither is rea-\n  sonable.\n       As to intentional encouragement, the majority inter-\n  prets Teva\u2019s 2007 press release as saying that its product\n  is a \u201cgeneric equivalent of GSK\u2019s cardiovascular agent\n  Coreg\u00ae,\u201d <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799994\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/799994\/metro-goldwyn-mayer-studios-inc-v-grokster-ltd\/\">id. at 30<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">\u2014and, from this, permits the inference\n  that Teva intended to encourage substitution of its product\n  for all of Coreg\u2019s indications, including CHF, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799994\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/799994\/metro-goldwyn-mayer-studios-inc-v-grokster-ltd\/\">id. at 29<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201330.\n  In other words, the majority holds that a generic can be\n  deemed liable for inducement for saying that its product is\n  a \u201cgeneric version\u201d or \u201cgeneric equivalent\u201d of a brand drug.\n  This is a drastic holding.

TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      23\n\n\n\n  exceptions not relevant here, ANDAs are suitable only for\n  \u201c[d]rug products that are the same as a listed drug,\u201d and\n  that \u201cthe same as\u201d includes drugs with label modifications\n  made for patent carve-outs). See generally supra Part I.A.\n  The system is inherently comparative. I therefore find it\n  highly unlikely that Congress intended to make generics\n  liable for simply stating what the law requires.\n      The majority also sees culpable intent in Teva\u2019s de-\n  scribing its product as a \u201ccardiovascular\u201d agent. See\n  Maj. 29\u201330. A well-understood adjective, \u201ccardiovascular\u201d\n  means relating to the heart. Carvedilol is a heart-related\n  drug; it\u2019s used to treat CHF, post-MI LVD, and hyperten-\n  sion\u2014all heart-related conditions. I cannot see how using\n  the word \u201ccardiovascular\u201d to describe a heart-related drug\n  could reasonably be viewed as evidencing culpable intent\n  to encourage practicing the specific claimed CHF method\n  in particular here\u2014or how this adjective does anything be-\n  yond what \u201cgeneric version\u201d or \u201cgeneric equivalent\u201d do in\n  terms of intent.\n      And still there remains causation. The majority never\n  explains how a reasonable jury could have found that this\n  press release (as it later appeared on Teva\u2019s website) af-\n  fected doctors\u2019 prescribing practices so as to cause their in-\n  fringement. Indeed, outside of testimony that doctors \u201cget\u201d\n  press releases, J.A. 11655, and that it\u2019s \u201cpossible\u201d doctors\n  read them, J.A. 11239, GSK supplied no evidence that any\n  doctor read this one before the litigation\u2014much less ac-\n  cessed it from Teva\u2019s website, and was then so moved by it\n  that it caused him or her to prescribe carvedilol in an in-\n  fringing manner, trumping every medical text along the\n  way.\n      We simply have a press release that describes a generic\n  version of a cardiovascular brand drug as a \u201cgeneric ver-\n  sion\u201d of a \u201ccardiovascular\u201d brand drug. From that alone,\n  the majority permits inferences of culpable intent to\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 64     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  24 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  encourage and causation. I fail to see how those inferences\n  are reasonable.\n                  3. The 2004 Press Release\n      The majority\u2019s final key piece of evidence is the 2004\n  press release, which announced Teva\u2019s \u201ctentative [FDA]\n  approval\u201d to market its product, described as \u201cthe AB-rated\n  generic equivalent of [GSK\u2019s] Coreg\u00ae . . . indicated for\n  treatment of heart failure and hypertension.\u201d J.A. 6347.\n      Before turning to whether these statements could show\n  intentional encouragement to infringe, some undisputed\n  facts must be acknowledged. First, this press release was\n  distributed several years before the \u2019000 patent issued, at\n  a time when Teva was pursuing a different pathway to reg-\n  ulatory approval. At that time, Teva\u2019s product was indi-\n  cated for treatment of CHF. But Teva ultimately pursued\n  the section viii pathway. Second, the press release an-\n  nounced the product\u2019s \u201ctentative approval,\u201d which has a\n  specific, legal meaning\u2014namely, that a patent or regula-\n  tory exclusivity stands in the way of final approval.\n  21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv)(II)(dd)(A); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.3(b);\n  see J.A. 10533. In other words, this \u201capproval\u201d had condi-\n  tions.\n      With that in mind, the question remains: what is there\n  in this press release to suggest intent to encourage in-\n  fringement of the (future-issued) \u2019000 patent? Like the\n  2007 press release, the majority sees culpable intent in\n  Teva\u2019s describing its product as the \u201cAB-rated generic\n  equivalent\u201d of Coreg. Maj. 28. But, for the reasons de-\n  scribed above, this cannot plausibly support liability within\n  Congress\u2019s framework in this area. And although the press\n  release does reference \u201cheart failure,\u201d given the circum-\n  stances here\u2014i.e., that the press release was distributed\n  years before the patent issued (under materially different\n  regulatory circumstances) and announced \u201ctentative\u201d ap-\n  proval\u2014inferring culpable intent from this press release\n  exceeds the bounds of reasonableness.\n\fCase: 18-1976     Document: 187      Page: 65    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.       25\n\n\n\n      And again: causation. To prove it, GSK first had to\n  show that Teva made this years-old press release available\n  on its website during the patent\u2019s term. This should have\n  been a crucial showing\u2014after all, this press release is one\n  of the three key pieces of evidence the majority relies on.\n  Once again, though, direct evidence is missing. And once\n  again, the majority is untroubled. It simply calls up some\n  inferences to bridge the gap. In particular, the majority\n  suggests the inference that, because the 2007 press release\n  was on Teva\u2019s website, and because Teva had a website\n  with some information about carvedilol, the 2004 press re-\n  lease must have been there too. Maj. 30\u201331. GSK, for its\n  part, never argued any of these inferences to the jury. And\n  while the majority faults Teva for not showing that the\n  2004 press release was not there, id. at 31, this is GSK\u2019s\n  case and its burden\u2014and besides, it\u2019s hard to blame Teva\n  for not rebutting a fact that GSK never even tried estab-\n  lishing.\n       But, for argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s assume the jury could\n  have reasonably found that GSK carried its burden on this\n  point. A further question remains: what is there to suggest\n  that any doctor saw it\u2014years later on the website\u2014then\n  relied on that as the basis for his or her infringing prescrib-\n  ing decisions? The answer: nothing. At least, that\u2019s the\n  answer the majority gives. See id. at 35\u201337. Nothing in\n  the record suggested that doctors were in the habit of\n  searching a generic\u2019s website for old press releases to help\n  them make life-or-death prescribing decisions. The most\n  we have is that Dr. McCullough saw the 2004 press release\n  (timing unspecified) and that it said what it said. The rest\n  is left to sheer possibility.\n      And indeed, it\u2019s possible that things panned out this\n  way. Maybe a doctor did search Teva\u2019s website for old\n  press releases, found this one (assuming it was there), and\n  then relied on that press release to make his or her pre-\n  scribing decision (at least three years after the date of this\n  press release), trumping every medical text along the way.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 66     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  26 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  Maybe every relevant doctor did. Many things are possible.\n  But \u201c\u2018[m]ere speculation\u2019 is not substantial evidence.\u201d OSI\n  Pharms., LLC v. Apotex Inc., <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">939 F.3d 1375<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1382 (Fed. Cir.\n  2019) (quoting Intell. Ventures I LLC v. Motorola Mobility\n  LLC, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">870 F.3d 1320<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2017)).\n      In sum, the 2004 press release\u2019s description of Teva\u2019s\n  product as the \u201cAB-rated generic equivalent\u201d of Coreg,\n  along with its reference to \u201cheart failure,\u201d would be a slen-\n  der enough reed upon which to rest culpable intent, given\n  that this communique was distributed years before the pa-\n  tent issued (under materially different regulatory circum-\n  stances) and announced an approval that was only\n  \u201ctentative.\u201d But it\u2019s the causation that truly vexes me. It\u2019s\n  the notion that, instead of the various medical texts (and\n  experience, and education), all along it was really the 2004\n  press release, found years later on the website, that caused\n  doctors\u2019 CHF prescribing decisions. In the face of uncon-\n  troverted evidence of the former, some evidence of the lat-\n  ter should be necessary. But there\u2019s none.\n   4. The Supposedly Substantial Other Evidence of Intent\n       The majority calls it \u201cinaccurate\u201d to observe that it re-\n  lies on only three key pieces of evidence as to culpable in-\n  tent during the skinny-label period. Maj. 24. It says\n  there\u2019s additional evidence too. 15 But while the majority\n  discusses the three pieces above in some detail, it only ges-\n  tures to the rest without much meaningful discussion.\n  Such references can hardly be enough to sustain a verdict,\n  and they return us to the uncertainty concerns plaguing\n  the first, vacated version of the majority\u2019s opinion. At\n\n\n\n      15 Much of this evidence comes in the form of trial tes-\n  timony that was not included in the record on appeal\u2014\n  which means it\u2019s testimony that GSK didn\u2019t rely on, and to\n  which Teva therefore had no occasion to respond. Anything\n  the majority cites as \u201cTrial Tr.\u201d references such testimony.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 67    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.     27\n\n\n\n  bottom, however, this other evidence just relates back to\n  the three key pieces.\n       There was \u201cextensive expert testimony,\u201d the majority\n  first insists without elaboration. Maj. 24. As best I can\n  tell, the majority is referring to Dr. McCullough and\n  Dr. Zusman, see <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at 26<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">\u2014Dr. McCullough saying that doc-\n  tors read labels, and Dr. Zusman agreeing that Teva\u2019s cir-\n  culations suggested reading labels if doctors have\n  questions. So, we\u2019re back to the skinny label\u2014the first of\n  the three key pieces of evidence. And if the skinny label\n  doesn\u2019t show intent, then neither does suggesting that doc-\n  tors should read it. 16\n      Teva\u2019s \u201cMonthly Prescribing References\u201d get some at-\n  tention elsewhere. See <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at 26<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201327. But, like the \u201cexten-\n  sive\u201d expert testimony discussed above, that\u2019s just for the\n  proposition that Teva intended doctors to read its labels.\n  Again, back to the skinny label.\n       The majority adds to the list Teva\u2019s \u201cproduct catalogs\u201d\n  and \u201cadvertising and promotional activities.\u201d <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 24<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">. I\n  presume it means Teva\u2019s catalogs discussed shortly after-\n  ward. But the only thing for which that evidence was relied\n  on was to show that Teva described its drug as the \u201cAB\n  rated\u201d equivalent to Coreg. See <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at 27<\/span><pre class=\"inline\"> (discussing 2008\n  and 2009 catalogs at J.A. 6221 and J.A. 6270). Statements\n  of equivalence were discussed with respect to the two press\n  releases\u2014the other two key pieces of evidence. So it\u2019s un-\n  clear what this adds to the intent calculus. And as before,\n  if this is evidence of intent, we should be disturbed.\n\n\n\n\n      16  Of course, because causation is an element, what\n  matters in the end is whether doctors did in fact not only\n  read but also rely on this label. See supra pp. 20\u201321. Recall\n  too that every relevant witness testified that he hadn\u2019t read\n  this label before prescribing.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 68    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  28 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n       Finally, the majority notes \u201ctestimony from Teva\u2019s own\n  company witnesses.\u201d Id. at 24. Maybe this means Teva\u2019s\n  marketing director (who the majority says \u201cadded carve-\n  dilol product information to the Teva website\u201d in 2007) and\n  regulatory-affairs director (who the majority says \u201cdis-\n  cussed\u201d the press releases with the jury). See id. at 31.\n  Whatever the case, this discussion just concerns the press\n  releases\u2014well-trodden ground. Or maybe instead the ma-\n  jority means Mr. Rekenthaler, who it quotes as having \u201cex-\n  pected\u201d or \u201cassum[ed]\u201d that doctors would use drugs as\n  labeled. Id. at 27. But this just brings us back to the\n  skinny label.\n      The bottom line is that, to the extent that this evidence\n  is relevant, its relevance depends on finding culpability\n  from the three key pieces of evidence\u2014i.e., the skinny label\n  or the two press releases, particularly their statements of\n  equivalence.\n                   B. The Full-Label Period\n      As with the skinny-label period, JMOL of no induce-\n  ment was necessary for the full-label period. The reason is\n  simple: nothing about doctors\u2019 prescribing practices\n  changed when Teva amended its label to the full version.\n  Both GSK and its experts confirmed as much. Appellant\u2019s\n  Br. 21 (\u201cDoctors continued to administer Teva\u2019s accused\n  product for infringing use during [the full-label] period\n  (without change from the partial label period) . . . .\u201d (em-\n  phasis added)); J.A. 12204\u201305 (GSK\u2019s counsel conceding\n  that any market impact as a result of the amendment was\n  \u201cminimal\u201d); J.A. 10699 (Dr. McCullough agreeing that, in\n  his practice, there was \u201cno difference in [his] prescribing\n  habits from when Teva had its skinny label to after Teva\n  amended to have its full label\u201d); J.A. 10754 (different GSK\n  expert testifying that his survey of 200 doctors indicated no\n  change in prescription patterns from pre- to post-amend-\n  ment).\n\fCase: 18-1976       Document: 187     Page: 69      Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.          29\n\n\n\n      The majority, for its part, identifies nothing about doc-\n  tors\u2019 prescribing practices that changed after Teva\n  amended its label. Maj. 33\u201337. If nothing about this\n  changed, then nothing Teva did during the full-label period\n  could have caused anything beyond whatever caused direct\n  infringement during the skinny-label period. And because\n  the record lacks evidence that Teva caused direct infringe-\n  ment during the skinny-label period, Teva cannot have\n  caused direct infringement during the full-label period\u2014\n  and therefore cannot have induced.\n           C. Why the Majority\u2019s Flawed Analysis Matters\n       In reinstating the jury\u2019s unsupportable verdict, the ma-\n  jority commits several errors\u2014some legal, some practical,\n  and all spelling trouble for skinny labels specifically and\n  inducement law generally. Below are three main concerns\n  with the majority\u2019s approach.\n             1. The Majority Weakens the Intentional-\n             Encouragement Requirement as to Labels\n       Direct infringement is strict liability; induced infringe-\n  ment is not. And when it comes to inducement\u2019s inten-\n  tional-encouragement requirement, the law draws a line\n  between encouraging, recommending, or promoting an in-\n  fringing use and merely describing that use. E.g., Takeda,\n  785 F.3d at 631. This line is important because while the\n  former provides evidence of intent, the latter does not. See\n  id. (collecting cases); HZNP, 940 F.3d at 702 (\u201cMerely de-\n  scribing an infringing use . . . will not suffice . . . .\u201d). The\n  majority blurs this line beyond recognition. 17\n\n\n\n      17   GSK would have us ignore this line entirely. Ap-\n  pellant\u2019s Reply Br. 28 (\u201cIt is doubtful whether such a dis-\n  tinction actually exists . . . .\u201d); see id. at 16 (\u201cTeva\u2019s partial\n  label encouraged doctors to infringe GSK\u2019s patent because\n  it described every limitation of the claimed method.\u201d).\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 70    Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  30 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n       Take the skinny label here.            GSK\u2019s expert\n  Dr. McCullough, despite having never read the label him-\n  self before making prescribing decisions, walked through it\n  and found piecemeal language that he could say \u201cmet\u201d or\n  \u201cmentioned\u201d each claim limitation in isolation. Supra\n  pp. 18\u201319. That was the extent of it. There was no testi-\n  mony or other evidence that this label language encour-\n  aged practicing the patented method, or that it even came\n  with a wink or nudge. At most, then, a reasonable jury\n  could have found that the skinny label described the in-\n  fringing use.\n       The majority somehow ends up at encouragement but\n  fails to justify how it got there. In particular, it never\n  meaningfully engages with the legal distinction between\n  encouraging, recommending, or promoting an infringing\n  use and describing it. Nor does it explain how a reasonable\n  jury could have found the former from the latter on this\n  record.

Here it\n  could not.\n      To start, the majority identifies no direct evidence of\n  causation by Teva. And it casts aside the direct evidence\n  from both sides pointing to the same things\u2014things other\n  than Teva\u2014as the cause. Supra pp. 20\u201321, 23\u201326. In-\n  stead, it says that it was \u201cfair\u201d for the jury to \u201cinfer\u201d causa-\n  tion from the existence of the skinny label itself and the\n  two press releases. Maj. 36. This conclusion relies on a\n  passing observation in one case saying: \u201c[W]e have af-\n  firmed induced infringement verdicts based on circumstan-\n  tial evidence of inducement (e.g., advertisements, user\n  manuals) directed to a class of direct infringers (e.g., cus-\n  tomers, end users) without requiring hard proof that any\n  individual third-party direct infringer was actually per-\n  suaded to infringe by that material.\u201d Id.

But this observation\n  is not a license to substitute speculation for proof. The ev-\n  idence-to-conclusion link must always make sense.\n       In some inducement cases, a jury might reasonably in-\n  fer causation based solely on circumstantial evidence.

Take this case. To accept that Teva\u2019s skinny\n  label was a substantial factor in causing doctors to infringe,\n  one would have to infer doctors read it to make prescribing\n  decisions (even though all three testifying expert cardiolo-\n  gists said they didn\u2019t); infer those doctors pieced together\n  the portions of the label to uncover a description of the in-\n  fringing use (maybe); infer those doctors interpreted that\n  description as an encouragement (no evidence); and then\n  infer those doctors relied on that description to make their\n  prescribing decisions (no evidence). Supra pp. 20\u201321. As\n  to the press releases, one would have to infer Teva made\n  them available during the relevant time period (maybe);\n  infer doctors read them during that time (no evidence); and\n  then infer doctors relied on some inducing message therein\n  to make prescribing decisions affecting their patients\u2019\n  health (no evidence). 18 Supra pp. 23\u201326.\n     Unlike the prototypical user-manual case, in which we\n  might permit the inference that a user relied on the man-\n  ual without requiring testimony to that effect, the\n\n\n      18   This is to say nothing of the causal implications of\n  pharmacies\u2019 ubiquitous automatic-substitution practices\u2014\n  where, for example, a doctor might write \u201cCoreg,\u201d but a ge-\n  neric is dispensed nonetheless. See J.A. 10750\u201351.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 74     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  34 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  inference might not hold up as well in this context\u2014with\n  highly educated users and well-studied products. And\n  whatever strength the inference has in a context such as\n  this, it crumbles when, as here, we have users who testi-\n  fied, and they either (1) failed to say they relied or (2) af-\n  firmatively said they didn\u2019t rely on the allegedly inducing\n  materials.\n       Moreover, unlike the prototypical user-manual case,\n  it\u2019s not as though the record here was wanting for another\n  cause. Both sides\u2019 expert cardiologists said under oath and\n  without contradiction that medical texts, education, and\n  experience caused their prescribing decisions. Supra\n  pp. 20\u201321. Under these circumstances, would accepting\n  the Teva-caused version of events amount to anything\n  more than speculation, given the chain of inferences re-\n  quired\u2014not all of them reasonably grounded in the record\n  evidence?\n      The most troubling part of all this is that the majority\n  never explains how a reasonable jury could have come out\n  this way on this record. Given the size of the infringing\n  doctor class here, it should have been easy to present testi-\n  mony of causation if that theory had a basis in fact. Cf.\n  TransUnion LLC v.

The law requires more from a plaintiff.\n                3. The Majority Creates Confusion\n                      About Skinny Labels\n      The majority\u2019s opinion will create confusion for every-\n  one. Under its analysis, the difference is indiscernible be-\n  tween this case and one in which the generic is safe.\n  Indeed, it\u2019s unclear what Teva even did wrong\u2014or, put an-\n  other way, what another generic in its shoes should do dif-\n  ferently.\n       Initially, the majority suggests that this is not a\n  skinny-label case. Nothing to see here, the majority reas-\n  sures concerned amici: the Act remains intact. See\n  Maj. 10\u201311. But it\u2019s hard to see how. As a matter of law,\n  this is a skinny-label case about the skinny-label provi-\n  sions. The Act\u2019s text makes that much clear: section viii by\n  its own terms references the brand-submitted patent \u201cin-\n  formation\u201d (i.e., patent declaration).              21 U.S.C.\n  \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(viii); see 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.53(c)(2)(O) (patent\n  \u201cinformation\u201d includes portions of label covered by method\n  patent). This patent information dictates whether a ge-\n  neric label is a section viii label. If a generic omits the uses\n  the brand has said are patented, the label is skinny. The\n  FDA understands that. See supra Part I.A (discussing\n  brand-dependent regulatory framework). So does the Su-\n  preme Court. Caraco, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728300\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/728300\/caraco-pharmaceutical-laboratories-ltd-v-novo-nordisk-as\/\">566 U.S. at 404<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201307. So should we.\n      What\u2019s more, the background facts here will seemingly\n  persist in most skinny-label cases.         Under the Act,\n  \u201c[g]eneric copies\u201d are essentially \u201cthe same as the original\n  drug.\u201d See H.R. Rep. No. 98\u2013857, pt. 1, at 14\u201315; accord\n  21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(iv); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.92(a)(1). Thus, bi-\n  oequivalence; comparison to a brand drug; duplication of a\n  brand\u2019s label (at least in part); reliance on a brand\u2019s clini-\n  cal-trial data; references to a drug\u2019s therapeutic class;\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 76     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  36 GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.\n\n\n\n  cursory press releases announcing a generic\u2019s regulatory\n  approval; doctors\u2019 assumptions about what going generic\n  means; pharmacies\u2019 generic substitution; a generic\u2019s\n  knowledge that some sales may occur from off-label, in-\n  fringing uses\u2014all of that will generally be there whether\n  there is inducement or not. See, e.g., AstraZeneca Pharms.\n  LP v. Apotex Corp., <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">669 F.3d 1370<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2012)\n  (discussing \u201cmarket realities\u201d of substitution that do not\n  implicate infringement). Those facts cannot sort induce-\n  ment from non-inducement.\n      So where did Teva go wrong in this case? Should it not\n  have followed the brand\u2019s sworn representations as to what\n  was patented? The majority offers no principled division\n  between this and what it suggests would be a true skinny\n  label. For decades, everyone has assumed they could rely\n  on what brands said about what their patents covered. The\n  FDA\u2019s skinny-label approval pathway and regulations are\n  expressly predicated on that. As far as adherence to Con-\n  gress\u2019s framework, this was about as faithful as it gets.\n      Or is the takeaway, instead, that Congress meant to\n  expose ANDA generics to liability for simply describing\n  themselves as the \u201cgeneric version\u201d or \u201cgeneric equivalent\u201d\n  of a brand drug? Given that the Hatch-Waxman Act\u2019s\n  framework requires ANDA generics to be the same as a\n  brand drug, and that doctors understand what being a ge-\n  neric means, this seems a dubious proposition.\n       One of amici\u2019s key criticisms of the first version of the\n  majority\u2019s opinion was that it was unclear what among the\n  muddled mass of evidence actually formed the basis of lia-\n  bility. So too here. It\u2019s unclear whether the skinny label\n  was enough\u2014or whether the press releases were, or some\n  of the other ancillary evidence in the record, \u201call of which\u201d\n  the majority suggests the jury \u201ccould have relied on.\u201d\n  Maj. 24.\n      The lack of clarity extends to the majority\u2019s character-\n  ization of its holding as \u201ccase-specific.\u201d See <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id. at 10<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201311.\n\fCase: 18-1976    Document: 187      Page: 77     Filed: 08\/05\/2021\n\n\n\n\n  GLAXOSMITHKLINE LLC v. TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC.      37\n\n\n\n  For example, the majority\u2019s new opinion relies on the post-\n  MI LVD indication remaining on the skinny label as a po-\n  tentially \u201ccase-specific\u201d circumstance. See <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.<\/span><pre class=\"inline\"> Not only is\n  this reliance problematic (for the reasons described above),\n  it\u2019s a mirage. If the majority were truly relying on this cir-\n  cumstance to distinguish this case, it would accept Teva\u2019s\n  argument that the damages should be confined to the ap-\n  propriate subset of infringing prescriptions to post-MI LVD\n  patients who also had CHF. See supra pp. 21\u201322. But,\n  given that this argument goes unacknowledged in the ma-\n  jority\u2019s opinion, the implication is that the press releases\n  alone\u2014with their references to \u201cgeneric version\u201d or \u201cge-\n  neric equivalent\u201d\u2014suffice to support the entire verdict, en-\n  compassing CHF patients more broadly. And if that\u2019s so,\n  then it\u2019s unclear why the majority\u2019s analysis of the skinny\n  label itself is relevant. Under the majority\u2019s holding, a\n  brand can just rely on statements of equivalence to capture\n  even that portion of the market that was specifically carved\n  out.\n      The only clear thing now is that no generic can know\n  until hit with the bill whether it\u2019s staying within the con-\n  fines of the law. Being unable to predictably rely on use\n  codes and patent declarations \u201cthrows a wrench\u201d into Con-\n  gress\u2019s skinny-label design. See Caraco, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728300\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/728300\/caraco-pharmaceutical-laboratories-ltd-v-novo-nordisk-as\/\">566 U.S. at 419<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n                        III. CONCLUSION\n      Before today, there was an equilibrium to the skinny-\n  label system\u2014one that allowed companies to make in-\n  formed, responsible decisions in this area. If a generic\n  wanted to avoid patented uses, it had the simple expedient\n  of omitting from its label the uses the brand identified.\n  And if a brand wanted to block a skinny label containing a\n  use it thought was patented, it had the simple expedient of\n  including that use in its FDA patent declaration. That\n  equilibrium is no more.\n      So, what\u2019s next? We are now on the majority\u2019s second\n  opinion in this case.

KABA ILCO CORPORATION\n\n\n\n PER CURIAM.\n      Gordon Gravelle filed this case against Kaba Ilco Corp.\n (Kaba), alleging federal- and state-law wrongs. The dis-\n trict court entered judgment against him on the merits and\n awarded attorneys\u2019 fees against him. After that award be-\n came final without his filing an appeal, he filed a motion,\n under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), for relief from\n the court\u2019s fee award. The court denied the motion. Grav-\n elle v. Kaba Ilco Corp., No. 5:13-cv-00642, 2019 WL\n 6851605 (E.D.N.C. Dec. 16, 2019) (Rule 60(b) Order). On\n Mr. Gravelle\u2019s appeal, we affirm the denial of the Rule\n 60(b) motion.\n                               I\n     Mr. Gravelle asserted three causes of action against\n Kaba under the Patent Act, the Lanham Act, and North\n Carolina law. The district court granted summary judg-\n ment in Kaba\u2019s favor on the merits of the claims and also\n awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to Kaba. When Mr. Gravelle ap-\n pealed, we affirmed the summary judgment in Kaba\u2019s fa-\n vor, but we vacated the fee award and remanded for\n reconsideration of the fees issue. Gravelle v. Kaba Ilco\n Corp., 684 F. App\u2019x 974 (Fed. Cir. 2017).\n     On remand, Kaba filed a new motion for fees. When no\n response from Mr. Gravelle had arrived at court by the due\n date, the district court granted the motion for attorneys\u2019\n fees in part, finding that Kaba was entitled to fees for pre-\n vailing on the federal claims (but not the state-law claim),\n but leaving the amount of fees to be determined later.\n Gravelle v. Kaba Ilco Corp., No. 5:13-cv-00642, 2018 WL\n 10320623 (E.D.N.C. Mar. 16, 2018) (Fees Entitlement Or-\n der).\n     Three days later, on March 19, 2018, the court received\n Mr. Gravelle\u2019s untimely response to Kaba\u2019s motion. The\n court construed the untimely filing as a motion for recon-\n sideration of the March 16, 2018 order. The court denied\n\fCase: 20-1370     Document: 38      Page: 3     Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n GRAVELLE   v. KABA ILCO CORPORATION                           3\n\n\n\n the motion, rejecting Mr. Gravelle\u2019s argument that he was\n the true prevailing party in the case. Order, Gravelle v.\n Kaba Ilco Corp., No. 5:13-cv-00642 (E.D.N.C. Nov. 2, 2018),\n ECF No. 111 (Order on Motion to Reconsider).\n     Kaba then made a submission detailing the amount of\n fees it claimed. Mr. Gravelle did not respond to the sub-\n mission. On August 8, 2019, the court entered an order\n awarding $68,393.49 in attorneys\u2019 fees to Kaba. Gravelle\n v. Kaba Ilco Corp., No. 5:13-cv-00642, 2019 WL 7584527,\n at *5 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 8, 2019) (Final Fees Order).\n      On November 1, 2019, Mr. Gravelle filed the Rule 60(b)\n motion at issue now. He sought relief from the court\u2019s\n grant of attorneys\u2019 fees on the ground that the district court\n should have excused the lateness of his March 19, 2018 fil-\n ing (based on excusable neglect) and therefore, in deciding\n the question of entitlement to fees, should have treated the\n arguments in that filing simply as a response to Kaba\u2019s mo-\n tion for fees, not as a motion for reconsideration (for which\n his burden was heavier) of the already-entered Fees Enti-\n tlement Order of March 16, 2018. Appx. 28\u201329. The late-\n ness of arrival of the March 19, 2018 filing, he said, was\n caused by a delivery error. In the Rule 60(b) motion, Mr.\n Gravelle also sought leave to supplement the March 19,\n 2018 filing to address why fees were not appropriate\u2014spe-\n cifically to provide \u201csubstantial justification\u201d for his litiga-\n tion behavior, such as his failure to attend a required\n deposition, which the court considered in granting fees. He\n merely sought leave to present such justifications; he did\n not provide them in the Rule 60(b) motion itself.\n     On December 16, 2019, the district court denied Mr.\n Gravelle\u2019s motion. Rule 60(b) Order, 2019 WL 6851605, at\n *1. The court determined that Mr. Gravelle failed to satisfy\n the threshold conditions for relief under Rule 60(b) because\n his Rule 60(b) motion was untimely and failed to demon-\n strate that he had a meritorious defense to the award of\n attorneys\u2019 fees. Id. at *2\u20133. The court therefore did not\n\fCase: 20-1370     Document: 38      Page: 4   Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 4                        GRAVELLE   v. KABA ILCO CORPORATION\n\n\n\n \u201caddress whether the mailing delay constitutes excusable\n neglect.\u201d Id. at *3 n.2.\n     Mr. Gravelle timely appealed. We have jurisdiction un-\n der 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).\n                               II\n     We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) mo-\n tion under the law of the regional circuit, here the Fourth\n Circuit. Rembrandt Vision Techs., L.P. v. Johnson & John-\n son Vision Care, Inc., 818 F.3d 1320, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2016).\n We thus review the denial for an abuse of discretion. Wells\n Fargo Bank, N.A. v. AMH Roman Two NC, LLC, 859 F.3d\n 295, 299 (4th Cir. 2017). We \u201cdo not review the merits of\n the underlying order but rather only whether the movant\n satisfied the requirements for Rule 60(b) relief.\u201d Id.\n     Rule 60(b) allows a court to \u201crelieve a party . . . from a\n final judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d for, among other\n things, \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable ne-\n glect.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). A party must first demon-\n strate \u201c(1) timeliness, (2) a meritorious defense, (3) a lack\n of unfair prejudice to the opposing party, and (4) excep-\n tional circumstances.\u201d Wells Fargo, 895 F.3d at 299. \u201cAfter\n a party has crossed this initial threshold, [it] then must\n satisfy one of the six specific sections of Rule 60(b).\u201d Id.\n (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n Here, the district court determined that Mr. Gravelle failed\n to meet the first two threshold requirements.\n      As to timeliness, the district court, noting Mr. Grav-\n elle\u2019s reliance on a ground stated in Rule 60(b)(1) (\u201cexcusa-\n ble neglect\u201d), invoked Rule 60(c)(1), which provides that a\n Rule 60(b) motion on that ground must be made \u201cno more\n than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the\n date of the proceeding.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1). Mr. Grav-\n elle filed his Rule 60(b) motion on November 1, 2019. The\n district court, agreeing with Kaba, concluded that the\n starting point for the one-year clock was the district court\u2019s\n\fCase: 20-1370     Document: 38      Page: 5    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n GRAVELLE   v. KABA ILCO CORPORATION                          5\n\n\n\n March 16, 2018 Fees Entitlement Order, because \u201cthe mail-\n ing delay, which forms the basis of [Mr. Gravelle]\u2019s excusa-\n ble neglect claim, affected his ability to timely file before\n the court\u2019s March 16, 2018[] order.\u201d Rule 60(b) Order, 2019\n WL 6851605, at *2. The Rule 60(b) motion was filed far\n more than one year after March 16, 2018, the district court\n concluded, and was therefore untimely under Rule 60(c)(1).\n     The district court\u2019s reasoning runs into a problem. Un-\n der Rule 60 and Fourth Circuit law, Mr. Gravelle could not\n have filed a Rule 60(b) motion within a year of the court\u2019s\n March 16, 2018 order. Rule 60(b) applies only to a \u201cfinal\n judgment, order, or proceeding,\u201d not to interlocutory or-\n ders. Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (emphasis added); see also Fed.\n R. Civ. P. 60(b) advisory committee\u2019s note to 1946 amend-\n ment (\u201cThe addition of the qualifying word \u2018final\u2019 empha-\n sizes the character of the judgments, orders or proceedings\n from which Rule 60(b) affords relief; and hence interlocu-\n tory judgments are not brought within the restrictions of\n the rule, but rather they are left subject to the complete\n power of the court rendering them to afford such relief from\n them as justice requires.\u201d). The March 16, 2018 Fees Enti-\n tlement Order was not a final order on attorneys\u2019 fees, but\n was interlocutory, because it merely resolved entitlement,\n not the amount. See Elbit Systems Land & C4I Ltd. v.\n Hughes Network Systems, LLC, 927 F.3d 1292, 1303\u201304\n (Fed. Cir. 2019). There was no finality until the district\n court issued its August 8, 2019 order determining the\n amount of fees owed\u2014more than a year after the March 16,\n 2018 order. The Fourth Circuit has recognized that \u201cRule\n 60(b) [is] not available for relief from an interlocutory or-\n der\u201d and that Rule 54(b) provides the avenue for such relief.\n Fayetteville Investors v. Commercial Builders, Inc., 936\n F.2d 1462, 1469\u201370 (4th Cir. 1991); see also, e.g., State Nat\u2019l\n Ins. Co. v. County of Camden, 824 F.3d 399, 406 (3d Cir.\n 2016); McKay v. Novartis Pharm. Corp., 751 F.3d 694, 701\u2013\n 02 (5th Cir. 2014); Kapco Mfg. Co. v. C&O Enters., Inc., 773\n F.2d 151, 153\u201354 (7th Cir. 1985).\n\fCase: 20-1370     Document: 38      Page: 6     Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 6                         GRAVELLE   v. KABA ILCO CORPORATION\n\n\n\n      Any error regarding Rule 60(c)(1), however, is harm-\n less, as denial of Mr. Gravelle\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was cor-\n rect regardless. Mr. Gravelle\u2019s motion addresses how the\n district court considered his March 19, 2018 filing\u2014as a\n motion to reconsider, not as an ordinary (but excusably\n late) response to Kaba\u2019s motion for fees. See Order on Mo-\n tion to Reconsider at 2\u20133 (applying the standard under\n Rule 54(b) for reconsideration of interlocutory orders). Alt-\n hough Mr. Gravelle could not have appealed the interlocu-\n tory Fees Entitlement Order or interlocutory Order on\n Motion to Reconsider when issued, he could have appealed\n them once final judgment was entered on attorneys\u2019 fees on\n August 8, 2019. Mr. Gravelle did not do so, but instead\n waited until after the time for an appeal had passed, see 28\n U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 (providing 30 days to appeal following entry\n of a judgment or order), and filed a Rule 60(b) motion. Hav-\n ing failed to appeal the district court\u2019s order after it became\n final, however, Mr. Gravelle cannot use Rule 60(b) as a sub-\n stitute to challenge the merits of the order. See, e.g.,\n United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, 559 U.S. 260,\n 270\u201371 (2010); Wells Fargo, 859 F.3d at 300 (holding a Rule\n 60(b) motion to be untimely after the movant failed to\n timely appeal); see also McCulloch v. Sec\u2019y of Health &\n Hum. Servs., 923 F.3d 998, 1001 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (\u201cTo rely\n on Rule 60(b) here would be to use it simply as a substitute\n for appeal to seek a change that could have been sought at\n the time that the appeal opportunity was available but by-\n passed.\u201d). For that reason, Mr. Gravelle did not present his\n excusable-neglect claim, which he first raised in his Rule\n 60(b) motion, until it was too late.\n      In any event, the district court\u2019s denial of the Rule 60(b)\n motion must be affirmed for an independent reason. Time-\n liness aside, the district court determined that Mr. Grav-\n elle failed to present \u201ca meritorious defense,\u201d Wells Fargo,\n 859 F.3d at 299, to the award of attorneys\u2019 fees. In his Rule\n 60(b) motion, he merely requested \u201cleave to supplement his\n prior opposition papers to Kaba\u2019s motion for attorney fees\u201d\n\fCase: 20-1370     Document: 38      Page: 7    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n GRAVELLE   v. KABA ILCO CORPORATION                         7\n\n\n\n and stated that he would, if permitted, give \u201csubstantially\n justified reason[s]\u201d for not disclosing documents or attend-\n ing his deposition. Appx. 35. The district court faulted him\n for not providing the justifications for these actions in the\n motion itself. See Rule 60(b) Order, 2019 WL 6851605, at\n *2 (citing Compton v. Alton S.S. Co., 608 F.2d 96, 102 (4th\n Cir. 1979)). On appeal, Mr. Gravelle argues that he filed\n an affidavit that supports his meritorious defense. See\n Gravelle Br. at 1\u20132. But he filed that affidavit, not with\n his motion, but only after Kaba responded to the motion.\n We cannot say that the court abused its discretion in not\n considering the submission made only at that stage. See\n Rule 60(b) Order, 2019 WL 6851605, at *2.\n                              III\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s\n order.\n     The parties shall bear their own costs.\n                        AFFIRMED\n\f",

KABA ILCO CORPORATION\n\n\n\n PER CURIAM.\n      Gordon Gravelle filed this case against Kaba Ilco Corp.\n (Kaba), alleging federal- and state-law wrongs. The dis-\n trict court entered judgment against him on the merits and\n awarded attorneys\u2019 fees against him. After that award be-\n came final without his filing an appeal, he filed a motion,\n under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), for relief from\n the court\u2019s fee award. The court denied the motion. Grav-\n elle v. Kaba Ilco Corp., No. 5:13-cv-00642, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2019 WL\n 6851605<\/span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D.N.C.

On\n Mr. Gravelle\u2019s appeal, we affirm the denial of the Rule\n 60(b) motion.\n                               I\n     Mr. Gravelle asserted three causes of action against\n Kaba under the Patent Act, the Lanham Act, and North\n Carolina law. The district court granted summary judg-\n ment in Kaba\u2019s favor on the merits of the claims and also\n awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to Kaba. When Mr. Gravelle ap-\n pealed, we affirmed the summary judgment in Kaba\u2019s fa-\n vor, but we vacated the fee award and remanded for\n reconsideration of the fees issue. Gravelle v. Kaba Ilco\n Corp., 684 F. App\u2019x 974 (Fed. Cir. 2017).\n     On remand, Kaba filed a new motion for fees. When no\n response from Mr. Gravelle had arrived at court by the due\n date, the district court granted the motion for attorneys\u2019\n fees in part, finding that Kaba was entitled to fees for pre-\n vailing on the federal claims (but not the state-law claim),\n but leaving the amount of fees to be determined later.\n Gravelle v.

The\n court construed the untimely filing as a motion for recon-\n sideration of the March 16, 2018 order.

Nov. 2, 2018),\n ECF No. 111 (Order on Motion to Reconsider).\n     Kaba then made a submission detailing the amount of\n fees it claimed. Mr. Gravelle did not respond to the sub-\n mission. On August 8, 2019, the court entered an order\n awarding $68,393.49 in attorneys\u2019 fees to Kaba. Gravelle\n v.

Aug. 8, 2019) (Final Fees Order).\n      On November 1, 2019, Mr. Gravelle filed the Rule 60(b)\n motion at issue now. He sought relief from the court\u2019s\n grant of attorneys\u2019 fees on the ground that the district court\n should have excused the lateness of his March 19, 2018 fil-\n ing (based on excusable neglect) and therefore, in deciding\n the question of entitlement to fees, should have treated the\n arguments in that filing simply as a response to Kaba\u2019s mo-\n tion for fees, not as a motion for reconsideration (for which\n his burden was heavier) of the already-entered Fees Enti-\n tlement Order of March 16, 2018. Appx. 28\u201329. The late-\n ness of arrival of the March 19, 2018 filing, he said, was\n caused by a delivery error. In the Rule 60(b) motion, Mr.\n Gravelle also sought leave to supplement the March 19,\n 2018 filing to address why fees were not appropriate\u2014spe-\n cifically to provide \u201csubstantial justification\u201d for his litiga-\n tion behavior, such as his failure to attend a required\n deposition, which the court considered in granting fees. He\n merely sought leave to present such justifications; he did\n not provide them in the Rule 60(b) motion itself.\n     On December 16, 2019, the district court denied Mr.\n Gravelle\u2019s motion.

A party must first demon-\n strate \u201c(1) timeliness, (2) a meritorious defense, (3) a lack\n of unfair prejudice to the opposing party, and (4) excep-\n tional circumstances.\u201d Wells Fargo, 895 F.3d at 299. \u201cAfter\n a party has crossed this initial threshold, [it] then must\n satisfy one of the six specific sections of Rule 60(b).\u201d Id.\n (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n Here, the district court determined that Mr. Gravelle failed\n to meet the first two threshold requirements.\n      As to timeliness, the district court, noting Mr. Grav-\n elle\u2019s reliance on a ground stated in Rule 60(b)(1) (\u201cexcusa-\n ble neglect\u201d), invoked Rule 60(c)(1), which provides that a\n Rule 60(b) motion on that ground must be made \u201cno more\n than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the\n date of the proceeding.\u201d Fed.

KABA ILCO CORPORATION                          5\n\n\n\n March 16, 2018 Fees Entitlement Order, because \u201cthe mail-\n ing delay, which forms the basis of [Mr. Gravelle]\u2019s excusa-\n ble neglect claim, affected his ability to timely file before\n the court\u2019s March 16, 2018[] order.\u201d Rule 60(b) Order, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2019\n WL 6851605<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2. The Rule 60(b) motion was filed far\n more than one year after March 16, 2018, the district court\n concluded, and was therefore untimely under Rule 60(c)(1).\n     The district court\u2019s reasoning runs into a problem. Un-\n der Rule 60 and Fourth Circuit law, Mr. Gravelle could not\n have filed a Rule 60(b) motion within a year of the court\u2019s\n March 16, 2018 order. Rule 60(b) applies only to a \u201cfinal\n judgment, order, or proceeding,\u201d not to interlocutory or-\n ders. Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (emphasis added); see also Fed.\n R. Civ. P. 60(b) advisory committee\u2019s note to 1946 amend-\n ment (\u201cThe addition of the qualifying word \u2018final\u2019 empha-\n sizes the character of the judgments, orders or proceedings\n from which Rule 60(b) affords relief; and hence interlocu-\n tory judgments are not brought within the restrictions of\n the rule, but rather they are left subject to the complete\n power of the court rendering them to afford such relief from\n them as justice requires.\u201d). The March 16, 2018 Fees Enti-\n tlement Order was not a final order on attorneys\u2019 fees, but\n was interlocutory, because it merely resolved entitlement,\n not the amount.

There was no finality until the district\n court issued its August 8, 2019 order determining the\n amount of fees owed\u2014more than a year after the March 16,\n 2018 order. The Fourth Circuit has recognized that \u201cRule\n 60(b) [is] not available for relief from an interlocutory or-\n der\u201d and that Rule 54(b) provides the avenue for such relief.\n Fayetteville Investors v.

KABA ILCO CORPORATION\n\n\n\n      Any error regarding Rule 60(c)(1), however, is harm-\n less, as denial of Mr. Gravelle\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was cor-\n rect regardless. Mr. Gravelle\u2019s motion addresses how the\n district court considered his March 19, 2018 filing\u2014as a\n motion to reconsider, not as an ordinary (but excusably\n late) response to Kaba\u2019s motion for fees. See Order on Mo-\n tion to Reconsider at 2\u20133 (applying the standard under\n Rule 54(b) for reconsideration of interlocutory orders). Alt-\n hough Mr. Gravelle could not have appealed the interlocu-\n tory Fees Entitlement Order or interlocutory Order on\n Motion to Reconsider when issued, he could have appealed\n them once final judgment was entered on attorneys\u2019 fees on\n August 8, 2019. Mr. Gravelle did not do so, but instead\n waited until after the time for an appeal had passed, see 28\n U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 (providing 30 days to appeal following entry\n of a judgment or order), and filed a Rule 60(b) motion. Hav-\n ing failed to appeal the district court\u2019s order after it became\n final, however, Mr. Gravelle cannot use Rule 60(b) as a sub-\n stitute to challenge the merits of the order. See, e.g.,\n United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1727\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/1727\/united-student-aid-funds-inc-v-espinosa\/\">559 U.S. 260<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n 270\u201371 (2010); Wells Fargo, 859 F.3d at 300 (holding a Rule\n 60(b) motion to be untimely after the movant failed to\n timely appeal); see also McCulloch v.

For that reason, Mr. Gravelle did not present his\n excusable-neglect claim, which he first raised in his Rule\n 60(b) motion, until it was too late.\n      In any event, the district court\u2019s denial of the Rule 60(b)\n motion must be affirmed for an independent reason. Time-\n liness aside, the district court determined that Mr. Grav-\n elle failed to present \u201ca meritorious defense,\u201d Wells Fargo,\n 859 F.3d at 299, to the award of attorneys\u2019 fees. In his Rule\n 60(b) motion, he merely requested \u201cleave to supplement his\n prior opposition papers to Kaba\u2019s motion for attorney fees\u201d\n\fCase: 20-1370     Document: 38      Page: 7    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n GRAVELLE   v.

Appx. 35. The district court faulted him\n for not providing the justifications for these actions in the\n motion itself.

On appeal, Mr. Gravelle argues that he filed\n an affidavit that supports his meritorious defense. See\n Gravelle Br. at 1\u20132. But he filed that affidavit, not with\n his motion, but only after Kaba responded to the motion.\n We cannot say that the court abused its discretion in not\n considering the submission made only at that stage.

See Roby v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 91 (2019).\n Because we disagree with the Veterans Court\u2019s application\n of controlling Supreme Court precedent and its interpreta-\n tion of 38 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 4.114, DC 7203 and 4.7, we vacate and\n remand.\n                        I. BACKGROUND\n     Harold L. Roby, Jr. actively served in the U.S. Army\n from January 30, 1975 to July 10, 1992. While still in ser-\n vice, Mr. Roby began experiencing difficulty swallowing\n and reflux. In August 1993, Mr. Roby was diagnosed with\n an esophageal disorder known as achalasia, which im-\n paired his ability to swallow food.\n      Mr. Roby applied for disability benefits under 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 4.114, which provides a schedule of disability ratings for\n digestive disorders. Within that schedule, DC 7203 pre-\n scribes ratings for esophageal strictures. See 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 4.114, DC 7203. The code recognizes three levels of disa-\n bility, expressed in terms of percentages, that \u201crepresent\n as far as can practicably be determined the average impair-\n ment in earning capacity resulting from\u201d the veteran\u2019s con-\n dition. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.1. DC 7203 provides the following\n percentage disability ratings: (1) 80% for esophageal\n\fCase: 20-1088     Document: 48     Page: 3    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ROBY   v. MCDONOUGH                                         3\n\n\n\n strictures that \u201c[p]ermit[] passage of liquids only, with\n marked impairment of general health\u201d; (2) 50% for esoph-\n ageal strictures that are \u201c[s]evere, permitting liquids only\u201d;\n and (3) 30% for esophageal strictures that are \u201c[m]oderate.\u201d\n 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.114, DC 7203. On October 1, 1993, the VA\n regional office (\u201cRO\u201d) granted service connection for Mr.\n Roby\u2019s achalasia, assigning the lowest available rating of\n 30% under DC 7203 for a \u201c[m]oderate\u201d esophageal stric-\n ture.\n     Mr. Roby\u2019s achalasia worsened following his initial di-\n agnosis, and on November 24, 2009, Mr. Roby submitted a\n claim for an increased benefit rating of 50% for esophageal\n strictures characterized as \u201c[s]evere permitting liquids\n only.\u201d To support his claim, Mr. Roby underwent a VA-\n ordered medical examination, in which he was diagnosed\n as having a history of achalasia and mild reflux esopha-\n gitis. Based on this initial medical examination, the RO\n denied Mr. Roby\u2019s claim for increased benefits.\n     Mr. Roby timely filed a Notice of Disagreement and un-\n derwent a second VA-ordered medical examination. The\n examiner found that Mr. Roby had an esophageal stricture\n that caused him difficulty swallowing food but not liquids.\n The examiner again found that Mr. Roby\u2019s symptoms were\n \u201c[m]oderate\u201d and did not warrant a higher benefit rating of\n 50% under DC 7203.\n     The Board remanded the examiner\u2019s findings based on\n Mr. Roby\u2019s sworn testimony concerning his limited diet. In\n September 2014, the VA examiner evaluated Mr. Roby\u2019s\n diet (which consisted of various solids, semisolids, and liq-\n uids) and noted that he would have \u201cto chew solids for a\n long time but they do pass\u201d after approximately 10\u201315\n minutes. J.A. 667. The examiner again found that Mr.\n Roby\u2019s symptoms only qualified as \u201c[m]oderate\u201d under DC\n 7203, and the RO denied Mr. Roby\u2019s request for a higher\n benefit rating.\n\fCase: 20-1088     Document: 48     Page: 4    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 4                                        ROBY   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n      Mr. Roby timely appealed the RO\u2019s decision to the\n Board. The Board denied Mr. Roby\u2019s claim for an increased\n benefit rating. The Board reasoned that, while Mr. Roby\n must chew small pieces of food to a liquid consistency be-\n fore swallowing, under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.7 1, Mr. Roby\u2019s acha-\n lasia symptoms more closely approximated the\n \u201c[m]oderate\u201d criteria for a 30% rating rather than the\n \u201c[s]evere, permitting liquids only\u201d criteria for a 50% rating.\n     Mr. Roby timely appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the\n Veterans Court. The Veterans Court first considered\n whether the terms \u201cpermitting\u201d and \u201c[p]ermitting passage\u201d\n from DC 7203\u2019s benefits ratings of 50% and 80%, respec-\n tively, referred to substances entering the mouth or, alter-\n natively, to substances passing through the esophagus.\n The Veterans Court agreed with Mr. Roby that these terms\n referred to passage through the esophagus because DC\n 7203 assessed esophageal strictures. Roby, 31 Vet. App. at\n 97.\n     The Veterans Court also weighed Mr. Roby\u2019s and the\n VA\u2019s proffered definitions of the term \u201cliquids\u201d in DC 7203.\n Id. The Veterans Court found that neither party\u2019s defini-\n tion helped illuminate the ordinary meaning of \u201cliquids.\u201d\n Id. at 97\u201398. The Veterans Court instead held that the\n term was ambiguous because the diagnostic code provided\n no definition and the structure, purpose, and regulatory\n history of DC 7203 were silent on the topic. Id. at 98.\n    Upon finding the term \u201cliquids\u201d ambiguous, the Veter-\n ans Court relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s Auer framework\n\n\n\n     1   This regulatory section states, \u201c[w]here there is a\n question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied,\n the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability pic-\n ture more nearly approximates the criteria required for\n that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.\u201d\n 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.7.\n\fCase: 20-1088     Document: 48     Page: 5    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ROBY   v. MCDONOUGH                                         5\n\n\n\n to defer to the VA\u2019s proffered interpretation of DC 7203. Id.\n at 99 (citing, inter alia, Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 462\n (1997) for the proposition that Auer deference is appropri-\n ate as long as the agency\u2019s proposed definition is \u201cnot\n plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation, and\n where there is no reason to suspect that it does not reflect\n fair and considered judgment on this matter\u201d). According\n to the VA, DC 7203\u2019s term \u201cliquids\u201d does not \u201cinclude foods\n that have a textu[r]al quality like purees, soft solids, semi-\n solids, or chewed solids.\u201d Id. at 101 (emphasis in original).\n The Veterans Court found that the VA\u2019s interpretation\n warranted Auer deference because it \u201cis consistent with the\n regulatory scheme [], which provides higher evaluations\n based on greater difficulty swallowing.\u201d Id. at 99 (citations\n omitted).\n     The Veterans Court also reasoned that Auer deference\n was appropriate because the VA\u2019s interpretation reflects\n the Secretary\u2019s \u201cfair and considered judgment.\u201d Id. The\n Veterans Court based this conclusion on the fact that, in a\n previously proposed amendment to DC 7203 (which was\n later withdrawn), the VA had defined the term \u201cliquids\u201d\n similarly to how it was interpreting the term in this case.\n Id. The Veterans Court also pointed out that, in a different\n diagnostic code concerning temporomandibular disorders\n (38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.150, DC 9905), the VA had defined \u201cfull liq-\n uids\u201d consistently with how it defined \u201cliquids\u201d under DC\n 7203. Id. at 99\u2013100 (citing, inter alia, Atlantic Cleaners &\n Dyers v. United States, 286 U.S. 427, 433 (1932) for the\n proposition that \u201cthere is a natural presumption that iden-\n tical words used in different parts of the same act are in-\n tended to have the same meaning\u201d).\n     After applying Auer\u2019s framework to the facts of this\n case, the Veterans Court \u201cstress[ed] that Auer deference is\n not necessary to [its] conclusion.\u201d Id. at 100. According to\n the Veterans Court, the less deferential standard espoused\n in Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944) also\n applies in this case because the VA\u2019s \u201cinterpretation was\n\fCase: 20-1088    Document: 48     Page: 6    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 6                                       ROBY   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n based on thorough consideration and valid reasoning and\n is consistent with other interpretations of \u2018liquid.\u2019\u201d Id.\n     The Veterans Court also rejected Mr. Roby\u2019s argument\n that, in light of DC 7203\u2019s ambiguous use of the term \u201cliq-\n uids\u201d and vague descriptions of the ratings criteria, the\n court should have resolved any ambiguities in Mr. Roby\u2019s\n favor pursuant to the pro-veteran canon described in\n Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 1301 (1994). Id. at 100\u2013101.\n The Veterans Court concluded that, because the VA\u2019s pro-\n posed interpretation qualifies for Auer deference, the pro-\n veteran canon does not need to be considered. Id. at 100.\n While it did not say so expressly, the Veterans Court pre-\n sumably also would afford the VA agency Skidmore defer-\n ence without regard to the Brown v. Gardner presumption.\n      The Veterans Court lastly addressed Mr. Roby\u2019s argu-\n ment that the Board erred under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4.7 by failing\n to consider whether his achalasia \u201cmore closely approxi-\n mate[d]\u201d the criteria for a 50% benefit rating under DC\n 7203. The Veterans Court concluded that the Board\n properly relied on testimony and additional record evi-\n dence to determine that Mr. Roby\u2019s achalasia did not ap-\n proximate the criteria for a 50% benefit rating under \u00a7 4.7\n in light of the definition of \u201cliquids\u201d the Board employed.\n Id. at 103.\n    Mr. Roby timely appealed the Veterans Court decision.\n We have jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292.\n                       II. DISCUSSION\n     Section 7292 grants our court \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to\n review and decide any challenge to the validity of any stat-\n ute or regulation or any interpretation thereof\u201d by the Vet-\n erans Court. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c). \u201cIn so doing, we review\n independently and without deference the [Veterans\n Court\u2019s] interpretations of statutory provisions and regula-\n tions.\u201d Hensley v. West, 212 F.3d 1255, 1259 (Fed. Cir.\n 2000). Our court cannot review a challenge to the Veterans\n\fCase: 20-1088    Document: 48      Page: 7    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ROBY   v. MCDONOUGH                                        7\n\n\n\n Court\u2019s factual determinations or to a law or regulation as\n applied to the facts of a particular case. See Sneed v.\n McDonald, 819 F.3d 1347, 1350\u20131351 (Fed. Cir. 2016)\n (quoting 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(1)\u2013(2)). We must, however,\n set aside an interpretation of a regulation \u201cthat was relied\n upon in the decision of the [Veterans Court]\u201d and that we\n find to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or\n otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d            38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 7292(d)(1)(A).\n     Mr. Roby argues on appeal that the term \u201cliquid\u201d is not\n ambiguous when considered in context. Mr. Roby further\n contends that, even if the term \u201cliquid\u201d were ambiguous,\n the Veterans Court erred in deferring to the VA\u2019s interpre-\n tation because it does not reflect the VA\u2019s fair and consid-\n ered judgment. And Mr. Roby asserts that the Veterans\n Court erred by failing to adequately explain how Mr.\n Roby\u2019s condition more closely approximated the \u201c[m]oder-\n ate\u201d rather than \u201c[s]evere, permitting liquids only\u201d rating\n of DC 7203, particularly given the ill-defined nature of the\n criteria. Finally, Mr. Roby concludes that the Veterans\n Court should have assessed the Board\u2019s findings under DC\n 7203 and \u00a7 4.7 in light of Gardner\u2019s pro-veteran canon and\n resolved any close questions in his favor. We address each\n argument in turn.\n                              A.\n      Mr. Roby first contends that DC 7203 unambiguously\n employs the term \u201cliquids.\u201d According to Mr. Roby, since\n DC 7203 does not explicitly define \u201cliquids,\u201d it should be\n given its ordinary meaning\u2014\u201ca substance that is not a\n solid or gas, flows readily, and has no independent shape.\u201d\n Appellant\u2019s Br. at 18. Under this ordinary meaning, Mr.\n Roby argues that \u201cliquids\u201d encompass foods having a liquid\n consistency as they pass through the esophagus (which he\n asserts includes foods like applesauce, baby food, yogurt,\n and mashed potatoes). Roby, 31 Vet. App. at 94. We agree,\n at least in part.\n\fCase: 20-1088     Document: 48      Page: 8    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 8                                         ROBY   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n      While the term \u201cliquid\u201d can mean different things to\n different people when considered in a vacuum, here it must\n be read in the context of the diagnostic code at issue and of\n the statutory scheme of which it is a part. Before finding\n an ambiguity, a court must consider not just the text, but\n the structure and history of that text, as well as its context.\n See McCarthy v. Bronson, 500 U.S. 136, 139 (1991) (\u201c[S]tat-\n utory language must always be read in its proper context.\n \u2018In ascertaining the plain meaning of [a] statute, the court\n must look to the particular statutory language at issue, as\n well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.\u2019\u201d)\n (quoting K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 291\n (1988)); see also Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. E.P.A., 573 U.S.\n 302, 321 (2014) (\u201c[R]easonable statutory interpretation\n must account for both \u2018the specific context in which . . . lan-\n guage is used\u2019 and \u2018the broader context of the statute as a\n whole.\u2019\u201d) (citing Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341\n (1997)).\n     As the Veterans Court found, because DC 7203 as-\n sesses esophageal strictures and speaks in terms of \u201cper-\n mitting passage\u201d through the esophagus, the term must\n refer to the nature of substances at the time they pass\n through the esophagus. Roby, 31 Vet. App. at 97. We find\n the Veterans Court\u2019s conclusion on that point compelling.\n     Despite this conclusion, the Veterans Court seemed to\n ignore it when finding an ambiguity in DC 7203. It predi-\n cated its finding of an ambiguity on three things: (1) the\n absence of an actual definition in the regulation itself; (2)\n the absence of any regulatory history discussing the term;\n and (3) the fact that the parties\u2019 proffered definitions dif-\n fered so pointedly. On this last point, the court noted that\n Mr. Roby appeared to contend that anything that is not a\n solid is a liquid and the government contended that any-\n thing that is not a liquid in its original state cannot be a\n liquid within the meaning of the regulation.\n\fCase: 20-1088     Document: 48     Page: 9    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ROBY    v. MCDONOUGH                                        9\n\n\n\n      We agree that the term \u201cliquids\u201d is not defined in the\n code or in its regulatory history. Indeed, the VA considered\n but walked away from any regulatory process that might\n have lent better clarity to either the code or its impact on\n the Board\u2019s analysis under \u00a7 4.7. But, the mere fact that\n there is no express definition and that the parties disagree\n about what a term means, even vehemently so, does not\n render a term genuinely ambiguous for purposes of a resort\n to Auer step two. While it is true that there is no express\n definition of the term \u201cliquids\u201d in the regulation or regula-\n tory history, both make clear that the term is not to be as-\n sessed based on what form a substance takes before it\n enters the mouth. As the Veterans Court recognized, what\n occurs in the mouth can greatly alter the state of whatever\n enters the mouth. Id. The Secretary\u2019s contention that\n whether a food item is a liquid must be based on its \u201cnatu-\n ral state\u201d or its state when it enters the mouth is irrelevant\n to the question of whether the term as used in DC 7203 is\n ambiguous.\n     The Secretary\u2019s reliance on dictionary definitions does\n not fare much better because the court did not differentiate\n between those definitions that speak of liquids without ref-\n erence to any oral action upon the food at issue and those\n that have been processed in the mouth. The question the\n court should have asked\u2014as its predicate finding re-\n quired\u2014is what constitutes a liquid at the time an esopha-\n gus permits passage of that item to the stomach. And it\n should have only considered definitions and arguments\n that speak to that context and that point in time. 2\n     This concern is heightened by the fact that the Veter-\n ans Court failed to keep in mind the remedial nature of the\n broader regulatory scheme of which DC 7203 is a part. The\n\n\n     2   While Mr. Roby points out a number of other weak-\n nesses in the Secretary\u2019s dictionary citations, we think it\n best that those points be considered on remand.\n\fCase: 20-1088    Document: 48     Page: 10   Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 10                                      ROBY   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n Supreme Court has previously noted that Congress\u2019s solic-\n itude towards veterans is \u201cplainly reflected in the [Veter-\n ans Judicial Review Act (\u201cVJRA\u201d)], as well as subsequent\n laws that place a thumb on the scale in the veteran\u2019s favor\n in the course of administrative and judicial review of VA\n decisions.\u201d Henderson ex rel. Henderson v. Shinseki, 562\n U.S. 428, 440 (2011). In legislating the VJRA, Congress\n stated that it \u201chas designed and fully intends to maintain\n a beneficial non-adversarial system of veterans benefits.\u201d\n H.R. Rep. No. 100\u2013963, at 13 (1988), reprinted in 1988\n U.S.C.C.A.N. 5782, 5794\u201395. Indeed, the VJRA is replete\n with provisions designed to make it easier for veterans to\n obtain benefits and to challenge denial of such benefits.\n The development of this veteran-friendly benefits scheme\n and its remedial nature was the very raison d\u2019\u00eatre for pas-\n sage of the VJRA. In addition to the VJRA, another \u201csub-\n sequent law[]\u201dCongress passed to favor veterans comprises\n the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act\n of 2017 (\u201cAMA\u201d). Veterans Appeals Improvement and\n Modernization Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115\u201355, 131 Stat.\n 1105 (codified in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.). Congress\n structured the AMA to avoid the various sources of delay\n associated with processing veterans\u2019 benefits claims. See\n Monk v. Wilkie, 978 F.3d 1273, 1275 (describing the AMA\u2019s\n enactment). Again, Congress evinced a desire to make it\n easier for veterans to access benefits they deserve.\n      For these reasons, we find that the Veterans Court\n failed to adequately consider the parties\u2019 arguments in con-\n text and jumped too quickly to its conclusion that DC 7203\n is ambiguous. We, thus, vacate and remand this matter\n for reconsideration of whether there is any true ambiguity\n in DC 7203. But that is not the only reason we find we\n must vacate the judgment in this case and remand for fur-\n ther inquiry.\n\fCase: 20-1088    Document: 48       Page: 11    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ROBY   v.

Only individuals who re-\n quired \u201c[t]ube feeding\u201d and were on a \u201cdiet restricted to liq-\n uid foods\u201d qualified for the 100-percent evaluation rating;\n the other three ratings applied to people whose diets were\n \u201crestricted to liquid and soft solid foods\u201d with gradations of\n limitations within these categories.

Reg. 27009 (May 8, 2012).\n      According to the government, the proposed changes\n demonstrate that the VA knew how to incorporate terms\n such as \u201csoft solid foods\u201d into its rating criteria. See Appel-\n lee\u2019s Br. at 21. The government argues that the fact that\n the VA chose not to include such terms in DC 7203\u2019s 50-\n percent evaluation rating supports the VA\u2019s interpretation\n of \u201cliquids\u201d as excluding \u201cfoods that have a textu[r]al qual-\n ity.\u201d Id.\n      A close reading of the withdrawn amendments to the\n evaluation ratings robs the government\u2019s position of any\n persuasive value. The VA\u2019s proffered interpretation of DC\n 7203\u2019s 50-percent evaluation rating excludes \u201cfoods that\n have a textu[r]al quality\u201d (such as \u201csoft solid foods\u201d) from\n the definition of \u201cliquids.\u201d But the VA\u2019s withdrawn amend-\n ments to DC 7203 only distinguished \u201cliquid\u201d and \u201csoft\n solid foods\u201d at the highest evaluation rating of 100-percent,\n a rating which would have required tube feeding; every\n other rating employed these terms together. The proposed\n amendments therefore only support the notion that the VA\n wished to differentiate \u201cfoods that have a textu[r]al qual-\n ity\u201d (such as \u201csoft solid foods\u201d) from \u201cliquids\u201d at the highest\n evaluation rating of DC 7203. Since Mr. Roby never sought\n to increase his benefits to the highest evaluation rating, it\n does not follow that the VA\u2019s withdrawn proposed amend-\n ments reflect the VA\u2019s \u201cfair and considered judgment\u201d con-\n cerning the definition of \u201cliquids,\u201d at the moderate level of\n impairment.\n\fCase: 20-1088     Document: 48       Page: 13     Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ROBY   v.

Such a withdrawn\n amendment cannot satisfy Auer\u2019s requirement of \u201cfair and\n considered judgment\u201d because it does not reflect the\n agency\u2019s \u201cauthoritative or official position.\u201d Kisor II, 139 S.\n Ct. at 2416 (internal quotation marks omitted). We there-\n fore find that the VA\u2019s withdrawn version of DC 7203 does\n not constitute substantial evidence for the Veterans\n Court\u2019s decision to grant Auer deference.\n                                2.\n     The VA\u2019s use of the term \u201cfull liquid\u201d in 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 4.150, DC 9905 similarly does not support the Veterans\n Court\u2019s decision to grant Auer deference. Unlike DC 7203,\n which is part of a schedule of ratings concerning the diges-\n tive system, DC 9905 is part of a ratings schedule relating\n to dental and oral conditions. Compare 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.114\n with 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.150. DC 7203, moreover, employs the\n term \u201cliquids,\u201d whereas DC 9905 provides the more specific\n description of \u201cfull liquid.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.114, DC 7203; 38\n C.F.R. \u00a7 4.150, DC 9905.\n     Despite these differences, the government contends\n that the unifying principle lies in Note (3) of DC 9905,\n which divides \u201cmechanically altered foods\u201d into four cate-\n gories: (1) \u201cfull liquid\u201d; (2) \u201cpuree\u201d; (3) \u201csoft\u201d; and (4) \u201csemi-\n solid foods.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 18 (citing 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.150,\n DC 9905, Note (3)). According to the government, because\n Note (3) of DC 9905 states that it is for \u201cVA compensation\n purposes,\u201d this indicates that its distinction between \u201cfull\n liquid\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d\/\u201csemisolid foods\u201d applies not just to DC\n 9905 but to \u201cthe entire rating schedule\u201d (including DC\n 7203).

As mentioned above, Note (3) of DC 9905 defines\n \u201cmechanically altered foods\u201d as encompassing, inter alia,\n \u201cfull liquid\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d\/\u201csemisolid foods.\u201d Since DC 7203\n never utilizes the term \u201cmechanically altered foods,\u201d there\n is no reason to overlay DC 9905\u2019s definitions onto DC 7203.\n And, Note (3)\u2019s statement that it is for \u201cVA compensation\n purposes\u201d does not indicate that DC 9905\u2019s categories of\n \u201cmechanically altered foods\u201d apply to the entire ratings\n schedule. Other diagnostic codes having nothing to do with\n disorders of the mouth\/esophagus also contain this state-\n ment. See, e.g., 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.71a, DC 5235\u20135243, Note (2)\n (\u201cFor VA compensation purposes, normal forward flexion of\n the cervical spine is . . . .\u201d); see also id. at Note (5) (\u201cFor VA\n compensation purposes, unfavorable ankylosis is a condi-\n tion in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracol-\n umbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or\n extension . . . .\u201d). We therefore find that the DC 9905\u2019s def-\n inition of \u201cmechanically altered foods\u201d also does not provide\n substantial evidence for the Veterans Court\u2019s decision to\n grant the agency deference. 3\n\n\n\n\n      3  Oddly, the Secretary points us to an online publi-\n cation\u2014Medline Plus\u2014to support its narrow definition of\n \u201cliquids.\u201d See Appellee\u2019s Resp.

The Veterans\n Court failed to cite any evidence that the VA has previously\n applied this definition of \u201cliquids\u201d in the context of DC\n 7203. See Roby, 31 Vet. App. at 99 (citing the VA\u2019s appel-\n late briefs and its treatment of \u201cfull liquid\u201d (as used in 38\n C.F.R. \u00a7 4.150, DC 9905) for this proposition). This is not\n surprising, as the VA could not have taken such a position\n prior to this litigation. Whereas the Board previously fo-\n cused on the state of food as it entered the mouth, the Vet-\n erans Court refocused the inquiry to the passage of foods\n through the esophagus. See id. at 97.

He points out that if \u201c[m]oderate\u201d es-\n sentially denotes a condition that is less than \u201c[s]evere,\u201d\n this is legally insufficient under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.7 because it\n makes it \u201cimpossible to determine whether a veteran\u2019s con-\n dition \u2018more nearly approximates\u2019 one rating criteria or the\n other.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 23.\n      We agree.      Without any regulatory definition of\n \u201c[m]oderate,\u201d it is impossible to determine under 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 4.7 whether Mr. Roby\u2019s disability status \u201cmore nearly ap-\n proximates the criteria required\u201d for the 50% than the 30%\n rating of DC 7203. And the government\u2019s rebuttal does not\n persuade us otherwise because it centers \u00a7 4.7\u2019s analysis\n around whether Mr. Roby\u2019s disability meets the higher rat-\n ing, rather than whether it more closely approximates it:\n \u201ca \u2018[s]evere\u2019 condition permits the passage of \u2018liquids only,\u2019\n a \u2018[m]oderate\u2019 condition permits greater passage.\u201d Appel-\n lee\u2019s Resp. Br. at 28. Indeed, as discussed above, it was the\n very uncertainty conveyed by these terms that prompted\n the VA to consider amending its regulations. The Veterans\n Court\u2019s discussion on this point also was based on the pred-\n icate assumption that the term \u201cliquids\u201d carries the mean-\n ing the VA attributed to it. It also seemed to believe that\n the deterioration in Mr. Roby\u2019s condition since he was first\n deemed to suffer a \u201cmild\u201d impairment was irrelevant; it is\n not.

He\n also asserts that whether a condition \u201cmore nearly approx-\n imates\u201d one ratings level or another should be liberally con-\n strued in the veteran\u2019s favor. According to Mr. Roby, the\n pro-veteran canon is a \u201c\u2018traditional tool\u2019 of construction\u201d\n that Supreme Court precedent requires the Veterans Court\n to apply in analyzing whether DC 7203 is ambiguous and\n in applying \u00a7 4.7 to the facts at issue. Id. at 21. Because\n the Veterans Court failed to apply the pro-veteran canon\n before concluding that DC 7203 is ambiguous and that Mr.\n Roby was only entitled to a \u201cmoderate\u201d disability rating,\n Mr. Roby argues that it committed reversible error. Id. at\n 22. Again, we agree.\n     We disagree with the Veterans Court\u2019s failure to con-\n sider the pro-veteran canon of construction. In Kisor II, the\n Supreme Court made clear that all canons of statutory con-\n struction are to be considered when assessing the meaning\n of statutes and regulations. 139 S. Ct. at 2414. This nec-\n essarily includes Gardner\u2019s pro-veteran canon.            On\n\n\n     6   This fact is important because the two inquiries\u2014\n what constitutes a \u201cliquid[]\u201d when it passes through the\n esophagus and whether an impairment is closer to a \u201cmild\u201d\n impairment or \u201cmoderate\u201d one\u2014cannot be considered in\n isolation.

On finding interpretive\n doubt in DC 7203\u2019s use of the term \u201cliquids\u201d and the impact\n of that term on Mr. Roby\u2019s rating under \u00a7 4.7, Kisor II and\n Kisor IV require the Veterans Court to consider the pro-\n veteran canon before resolving the questions before it. The\n Secretary is wrong when it says consideration of the Gard-\n ner canon is optional, at the VA\u2019s discretion. While the\n need to resort to the canon may be obviated where no in-\n terpretive doubt remains after consideration of more tradi-\n tional tools of construction, once it is clear interpretive\n doubt remains, as the Veterans Court concluded, the pro-\n veteran canon of construction must be considered.\n      This court has not definitively resolved at what stage\n the pro-veteran canon applies and whether it precedes any\n claims of deference to an agency interpretation. Compare\n Kisor v. McDonough, 995 F.3d 1347, 1359\u201361 (Fed. Cir.\n 2021) (denying petition for rehearing en banc) (Hughes,\n Circuit J., concurring), with id. at 1363 (O\u2019Malley, Circuit\n J., dissenting) and Kisor IV, 995 F.3d at 1326 (Reyna, Cir-\n cuit J., dissenting). Because we find that no deference is\n due to the Board\u2019s interpretation of DC 7203 and its appli-\n cation of \u00a7 4.7, however, we need not resolve that question\n today.\n     It suffices that we vacate and remand for the Veterans\n Court to take into account the pro-veteran canon of con-\n struction. While consideration of the Gardner presumption\n does not necessarily mean Mr. Roby\u2019s interpretations pre-\n vail, it must be factored into the balance.\n\fCase: 20-1088    Document: 48    Page: 19   Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ROBY   v.

BACKGROUND\n     Harold L. Roby, Jr. actively served in the U.S. Army\n from January 30, 1975 to July 10, 1992. While still in ser-\n vice, Mr. Roby began experiencing difficulty swallowing\n and reflux. In August 1993, Mr. Roby was diagnosed with\n an esophageal disorder known as achalasia, which im-\n paired his ability to swallow food.\n      Mr. Roby applied for disability benefits under 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 4.114, which provides a schedule of disability ratings for\n digestive disorders. Within that schedule, DC 7203 pre-\n scribes ratings for esophageal strictures. See 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 4.114, DC 7203. The code recognizes three levels of disa-\n bility, expressed in terms of percentages, that \u201crepresent\n as far as can practicably be determined the average impair-\n ment in earning capacity resulting from\u201d the veteran\u2019s con-\n dition. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.1. DC 7203 provides the following\n percentage disability ratings: (1) 80% for esophageal\n\fCase: 20-1088     Document: 48     Page: 3    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ROBY   v. MCDONOUGH                                         3\n\n\n\n strictures that \u201c[p]ermit[] passage of liquids only, with\n marked impairment of general health\u201d; (2) 50% for esoph-\n ageal strictures that are \u201c[s]evere, permitting liquids only\u201d;\n and (3) 30% for esophageal strictures that are \u201c[m]oderate.\u201d\n 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.114, DC 7203. On October 1, 1993, the VA\n regional office (\u201cRO\u201d) granted service connection for Mr.\n Roby\u2019s achalasia, assigning the lowest available rating of\n 30% under DC 7203 for a \u201c[m]oderate\u201d esophageal stric-\n ture.\n     Mr. Roby\u2019s achalasia worsened following his initial di-\n agnosis, and on November 24, 2009, Mr. Roby submitted a\n claim for an increased benefit rating of 50% for esophageal\n strictures characterized as \u201c[s]evere permitting liquids\n only.\u201d To support his claim, Mr. Roby underwent a VA-\n ordered medical examination, in which he was diagnosed\n as having a history of achalasia and mild reflux esopha-\n gitis. Based on this initial medical examination, the RO\n denied Mr. Roby\u2019s claim for increased benefits.\n     Mr. Roby timely filed a Notice of Disagreement and un-\n derwent a second VA-ordered medical examination. The\n examiner found that Mr. Roby had an esophageal stricture\n that caused him difficulty swallowing food but not liquids.\n The examiner again found that Mr. Roby\u2019s symptoms were\n \u201c[m]oderate\u201d and did not warrant a higher benefit rating of\n 50% under DC 7203.\n     The Board remanded the examiner\u2019s findings based on\n Mr. Roby\u2019s sworn testimony concerning his limited diet. In\n September 2014, the VA examiner evaluated Mr. Roby\u2019s\n diet (which consisted of various solids, semisolids, and liq-\n uids) and noted that he would have \u201cto chew solids for a\n long time but they do pass\u201d after approximately 10\u201315\n minutes. J.A. 667. The examiner again found that Mr.\n Roby\u2019s symptoms only qualified as \u201c[m]oderate\u201d under DC\n 7203, and the RO denied Mr. Roby\u2019s request for a higher\n benefit rating.\n\fCase: 20-1088     Document: 48     Page: 4    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 4                                        ROBY   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n      Mr. Roby timely appealed the RO\u2019s decision to the\n Board. The Board denied Mr. Roby\u2019s claim for an increased\n benefit rating. The Board reasoned that, while Mr. Roby\n must chew small pieces of food to a liquid consistency be-\n fore swallowing, under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.7 1, Mr. Roby\u2019s acha-\n lasia symptoms more closely approximated the\n \u201c[m]oderate\u201d criteria for a 30% rating rather than the\n \u201c[s]evere, permitting liquids only\u201d criteria for a 50% rating.\n     Mr. Roby timely appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the\n Veterans Court. The Veterans Court first considered\n whether the terms \u201cpermitting\u201d and \u201c[p]ermitting passage\u201d\n from DC 7203\u2019s benefits ratings of 50% and 80%, respec-\n tively, referred to substances entering the mouth or, alter-\n natively, to substances passing through the esophagus.\n The Veterans Court agreed with Mr. Roby that these terms\n referred to passage through the esophagus because DC\n 7203 assessed esophageal strictures. Roby, 31 Vet. App. at\n 97.\n     The Veterans Court also weighed Mr. Roby\u2019s and the\n VA\u2019s proffered definitions of the term \u201cliquids\u201d in DC 7203.\n Id. The Veterans Court found that neither party\u2019s defini-\n tion helped illuminate the ordinary meaning of \u201cliquids.\u201d\n Id. at 97\u201398. The Veterans Court instead held that the\n term was ambiguous because the diagnostic code provided\n no definition and the structure, purpose, and regulatory\n history of DC 7203 were silent on the topic. Id. at 98.\n    Upon finding the term \u201cliquids\u201d ambiguous, the Veter-\n ans Court relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s Auer framework\n\n\n\n     1   This regulatory section states, \u201c[w]here there is a\n question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied,\n the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability pic-\n ture more nearly approximates the criteria required for\n that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.\u201d\n 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.7.\n\fCase: 20-1088     Document: 48     Page: 5    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ROBY   v.

We must, however,\n set aside an interpretation of a regulation \u201cthat was relied\n upon in the decision of the [Veterans Court]\u201d and that we\n find to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or\n otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d            38 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 7292(d)(1)(A).\n     Mr. Roby argues on appeal that the term \u201cliquid\u201d is not\n ambiguous when considered in context. Mr. Roby further\n contends that, even if the term \u201cliquid\u201d were ambiguous,\n the Veterans Court erred in deferring to the VA\u2019s interpre-\n tation because it does not reflect the VA\u2019s fair and consid-\n ered judgment.

Finally, Mr. Roby concludes that the Veterans\n Court should have assessed the Board\u2019s findings under DC\n 7203 and \u00a7 4.7 in light of Gardner\u2019s pro-veteran canon and\n resolved any close questions in his favor.

Under this ordinary meaning, Mr.\n Roby argues that \u201cliquids\u201d encompass foods having a liquid\n consistency as they pass through the esophagus (which he\n asserts includes foods like applesauce, baby food, yogurt,\n and mashed potatoes).

Roby, 31 Vet. App. at 97. We find\n the Veterans Court\u2019s conclusion on that point compelling.\n     Despite this conclusion, the Veterans Court seemed to\n ignore it when finding an ambiguity in DC 7203. It predi-\n cated its finding of an ambiguity on three things: (1) the\n absence of an actual definition in the regulation itself; (2)\n the absence of any regulatory history discussing the term;\n and (3) the fact that the parties\u2019 proffered definitions dif-\n fered so pointedly. On this last point, the court noted that\n Mr. Roby appeared to contend that anything that is not a\n solid is a liquid and the government contended that any-\n thing that is not a liquid in its original state cannot be a\n liquid within the meaning of the regulation.\n\fCase: 20-1088     Document: 48     Page: 9    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ROBY    v. MCDONOUGH                                        9\n\n\n\n      We agree that the term \u201cliquids\u201d is not defined in the\n code or in its regulatory history. Indeed, the VA considered\n but walked away from any regulatory process that might\n have lent better clarity to either the code or its impact on\n the Board\u2019s analysis under \u00a7 4.7. But, the mere fact that\n there is no express definition and that the parties disagree\n about what a term means, even vehemently so, does not\n render a term genuinely ambiguous for purposes of a resort\n to Auer step two. While it is true that there is no express\n definition of the term \u201cliquids\u201d in the regulation or regula-\n tory history, both make clear that the term is not to be as-\n sessed based on what form a substance takes before it\n enters the mouth. As the Veterans Court recognized, what\n occurs in the mouth can greatly alter the state of whatever\n enters the mouth. Id. The Secretary\u2019s contention that\n whether a food item is a liquid must be based on its \u201cnatu-\n ral state\u201d or its state when it enters the mouth is irrelevant\n to the question of whether the term as used in DC 7203 is\n ambiguous.\n     The Secretary\u2019s reliance on dictionary definitions does\n not fare much better because the court did not differentiate\n between those definitions that speak of liquids without ref-\n erence to any oral action upon the food at issue and those\n that have been processed in the mouth. The question the\n court should have asked\u2014as its predicate finding re-\n quired\u2014is what constitutes a liquid at the time an esopha-\n gus permits passage of that item to the stomach. And it\n should have only considered definitions and arguments\n that speak to that context and that point in time. 2\n     This concern is heightened by the fact that the Veter-\n ans Court failed to keep in mind the remedial nature of the\n broader regulatory scheme of which DC 7203 is a part. The\n\n\n     2   While Mr. Roby points out a number of other weak-\n nesses in the Secretary\u2019s dictionary citations, we think it\n best that those points be considered on remand.\n\fCase: 20-1088    Document: 48     Page: 10   Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 10                                      ROBY   v.

Indeed, the VJRA is replete\n with provisions designed to make it easier for veterans to\n obtain benefits and to challenge denial of such benefits.\n The development of this veteran-friendly benefits scheme\n and its remedial nature was the very raison d\u2019\u00eatre for pas-\n sage of the VJRA.

Reg. 27009 (May 8, 2012).\n      According to the government, the proposed changes\n demonstrate that the VA knew how to incorporate terms\n such as \u201csoft solid foods\u201d into its rating criteria. See Appel-\n lee\u2019s Br. at 21. The government argues that the fact that\n the VA chose not to include such terms in DC 7203\u2019s 50-\n percent evaluation rating supports the VA\u2019s interpretation\n of \u201cliquids\u201d as excluding \u201cfoods that have a textu[r]al qual-\n ity.\u201d Id.\n      A close reading of the withdrawn amendments to the\n evaluation ratings robs the government\u2019s position of any\n persuasive value. The VA\u2019s proffered interpretation of DC\n 7203\u2019s 50-percent evaluation rating excludes \u201cfoods that\n have a textu[r]al quality\u201d (such as \u201csoft solid foods\u201d) from\n the definition of \u201cliquids.\u201d But the VA\u2019s withdrawn amend-\n ments to DC 7203 only distinguished \u201cliquid\u201d and \u201csoft\n solid foods\u201d at the highest evaluation rating of 100-percent,\n a rating which would have required tube feeding; every\n other rating employed these terms together. The proposed\n amendments therefore only support the notion that the VA\n wished to differentiate \u201cfoods that have a textu[r]al qual-\n ity\u201d (such as \u201csoft solid foods\u201d) from \u201cliquids\u201d at the highest\n evaluation rating of DC 7203. Since Mr. Roby never sought\n to increase his benefits to the highest evaluation rating, it\n does not follow that the VA\u2019s withdrawn proposed amend-\n ments reflect the VA\u2019s \u201cfair and considered judgment\u201d con-\n cerning the definition of \u201cliquids,\u201d at the moderate level of\n impairment.\n\fCase: 20-1088     Document: 48       Page: 13     Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ROBY   v.

The VA withdrew its proposed\n changes to DC 7203 because they were based \u201cupon out-\n dated and partially incomplete or irrelevant information.\u201d\n 77 Fed. Reg. 27009 (May 8, 2012). Such a withdrawn\n amendment cannot satisfy Auer\u2019s requirement of \u201cfair and\n considered judgment\u201d because it does not reflect the\n agency\u2019s \u201cauthoritative or official position.\u201d Kisor II, 139 S.\n Ct. at 2416 (internal quotation marks omitted). We there-\n fore find that the VA\u2019s withdrawn version of DC 7203 does\n not constitute substantial evidence for the Veterans\n Court\u2019s decision to grant Auer deference.\n                                2.\n     The VA\u2019s use of the term \u201cfull liquid\u201d in 38 C.F.R.\n \u00a7 4.150, DC 9905 similarly does not support the Veterans\n Court\u2019s decision to grant Auer deference. Unlike DC 7203,\n which is part of a schedule of ratings concerning the diges-\n tive system, DC 9905 is part of a ratings schedule relating\n to dental and oral conditions. Compare 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.114\n with 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.150. DC 7203, moreover, employs the\n term \u201cliquids,\u201d whereas DC 9905 provides the more specific\n description of \u201cfull liquid.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.114, DC 7203; 38\n C.F.R. \u00a7 4.150, DC 9905.\n     Despite these differences, the government contends\n that the unifying principle lies in Note (3) of DC 9905,\n which divides \u201cmechanically altered foods\u201d into four cate-\n gories: (1) \u201cfull liquid\u201d; (2) \u201cpuree\u201d; (3) \u201csoft\u201d; and (4) \u201csemi-\n solid foods.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 18 (citing 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.150,\n DC 9905, Note (3)). According to the government, because\n Note (3) of DC 9905 states that it is for \u201cVA compensation\n purposes,\u201d this indicates that its distinction between \u201cfull\n liquid\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d\/\u201csemisolid foods\u201d applies not just to DC\n 9905 but to \u201cthe entire rating schedule\u201d (including DC\n 7203).

As mentioned above, Note (3) of DC 9905 defines\n \u201cmechanically altered foods\u201d as encompassing, inter alia,\n \u201cfull liquid\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d\/\u201csemisolid foods.\u201d Since DC 7203\n never utilizes the term \u201cmechanically altered foods,\u201d there\n is no reason to overlay DC 9905\u2019s definitions onto DC 7203.\n And, Note (3)\u2019s statement that it is for \u201cVA compensation\n purposes\u201d does not indicate that DC 9905\u2019s categories of\n \u201cmechanically altered foods\u201d apply to the entire ratings\n schedule. Other diagnostic codes having nothing to do with\n disorders of the mouth\/esophagus also contain this state-\n ment. See, e.g., 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.71a, DC 5235\u20135243, Note (2)\n (\u201cFor VA compensation purposes, normal forward flexion of\n the cervical spine is . . . .\u201d); see also id. at Note (5) (\u201cFor VA\n compensation purposes, unfavorable ankylosis is a condi-\n tion in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracol-\n umbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or\n extension . . . .\u201d). We therefore find that the DC 9905\u2019s def-\n inition of \u201cmechanically altered foods\u201d also does not provide\n substantial evidence for the Veterans Court\u2019s decision to\n grant the agency deference. 3\n\n\n\n\n      3  Oddly, the Secretary points us to an online publi-\n cation\u2014Medline Plus\u2014to support its narrow definition of\n \u201cliquids.\u201d See Appellee\u2019s Resp.

MCDONOUGH                                       17\n\n\n\n prohibited from reviewing the VA\u2019s predicate legal conclu-\n sions. 6\n     We thus also vacate and remand the issue of whether\n Mr. Roby\u2019s achalasia more closely approximates the 50%\n disability rating for further consideration and elaboration.\n                              D.\n     Mr. Roby finally argues that, \u201ceven if the regulation\u2019s\n use of the term \u2018liquids\u2019 initially appeared ambiguous as to\n chewed solids,\u201d the Veterans Court erred by failing to \u201cin-\n terpret[] the [code] in [] Roby\u2019s favor\u201d under the pro-veteran\n canon espoused in Gardner. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 22\u201323. He\n also asserts that whether a condition \u201cmore nearly approx-\n imates\u201d one ratings level or another should be liberally con-\n strued in the veteran\u2019s favor. According to Mr. Roby, the\n pro-veteran canon is a \u201c\u2018traditional tool\u2019 of construction\u201d\n that Supreme Court precedent requires the Veterans Court\n to apply in analyzing whether DC 7203 is ambiguous and\n in applying \u00a7 4.7 to the facts at issue. Id. at 21. Because\n the Veterans Court failed to apply the pro-veteran canon\n before concluding that DC 7203 is ambiguous and that Mr.\n Roby was only entitled to a \u201cmoderate\u201d disability rating,\n Mr. Roby argues that it committed reversible error. Id. at\n 22. Again, we agree.\n     We disagree with the Veterans Court\u2019s failure to con-\n sider the pro-veteran canon of construction. In Kisor II, the\n Supreme Court made clear that all canons of statutory con-\n struction are to be considered when assessing the meaning\n of statutes and regulations. 139 S. Ct. at 2414. This nec-\n essarily includes Gardner\u2019s pro-veteran canon.            On\n\n\n     6   This fact is important because the two inquiries\u2014\n what constitutes a \u201cliquid[]\u201d when it passes through the\n esophagus and whether an impairment is closer to a \u201cmild\u201d\n impairment or \u201cmoderate\u201d one\u2014cannot be considered in\n isolation. The one conclusion clearly impacts the other.\n\fCase: 20-1088    Document: 48     Page: 18   Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 18                                      ROBY   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n remand, our court in Kisor v. McDonough created an effec-\n tive hierarchy of canons, placing Gardner\u2019s pro-veteran\n canon behind other interpretive canons and holding that\n Gardner was to be applied only when there remains inter-\n pretive doubt as to the statutory or regulatory language at\n issue. <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">995 F.3d 1316<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1325\u201326 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (\u201cKisor IV\u201d).\n     Under Kisor II\u2019s and Kisor IV\u2019s framework, the Veter-\n ans Court\u2019s holding cannot stand. On finding interpretive\n doubt in DC 7203\u2019s use of the term \u201cliquids\u201d and the impact\n of that term on Mr. Roby\u2019s rating under \u00a7 4.7, Kisor II and\n Kisor IV require the Veterans Court to consider the pro-\n veteran canon before resolving the questions before it. The\n Secretary is wrong when it says consideration of the Gard-\n ner canon is optional, at the VA\u2019s discretion. While the\n need to resort to the canon may be obviated where no in-\n terpretive doubt remains after consideration of more tradi-\n tional tools of construction, once it is clear interpretive\n doubt remains, as the Veterans Court concluded, the pro-\n veteran canon of construction must be considered.\n      This court has not definitively resolved at what stage\n the pro-veteran canon applies and whether it precedes any\n claims of deference to an agency interpretation. Compare\n Kisor v. McDonough, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">995 F.3d 1347<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1359\u201361 (Fed.

Because we find that no deference is\n due to the Board\u2019s interpretation of DC 7203 and its appli-\n cation of \u00a7 4.7, however, we need not resolve that question\n today.\n     It suffices that we vacate and remand for the Veterans\n Court to take into account the pro-veteran canon of con-\n struction. While consideration of the Gardner presumption\n does not necessarily mean Mr. Roby\u2019s interpretations pre-\n vail, it must be factored into the balance.\n\fCase: 20-1088    Document: 48    Page: 19   Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ROBY   v.

US\n\n\n\n Before NEWMAN, O\u2019MALLEY, and TARANTO, Circuit Judges.\n O\u2019MALLEY, Circuit Judge.\n     This case has been before us on four prior occasions. At\n issue is the government\u2019s obligation under World War II-\n era contracts to indemnify Shell Oil Company; Atlantic\n Richfield Company; Texaco, Inc.; and Union Oil Company\n of California (collectively, \u201cthe Oil Companies\u201d) for environ-\n mental remediation costs they incurred due to their pro-\n duction of aviation gasoline (\u201cavgas\u201d) for the war effort. We\n have held that the government is contractually liable to re-\n imburse these costs. Shell Oil Co. v. United States, 751\n F.3d 1282, 1293 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (\u201cLiability Decision\u201d). And\n we have confirmed that the government\u2019s contractual obli-\n gations encompass all of the remediation costs that the Oil\n Companies have incurred. Shell Oil Co. v. United States,\n 896 F.3d 1299, 1310\u201311 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (\u201cDamages Deci-\n sion\u201d). Consistent with those decisions, in 2019, the gov-\n ernment reimbursed the Oil Companies for the\n remediation costs incurred through November 2015, and\n interest thereon.\n     Because remediation efforts remain ongoing, the Oil\n Companies filed suit in the United States Court of Federal\n Claims (\u201cClaims Court\u201d), seeking damages for additional\n remediation costs incurred between November 2015 and\n November 2019, and for interest related to those costs. The\n Claims Court found the government liable for remediation\n costs incurred from November 30, 2015 through September\n 30, 2019, as well as interest accruing through the date of\n final payment. Shell Oil Co. v. United States, 148 Fed. Cl.\n 781, 796\u201397 (2020) (\u201cShell II\u201d). The government appeals\n from that decision, arguing that: (1) res judicata bars the\n Oil Companies\u2019 claims for damages; and (2) the Claims\n Court erred in finding that it had jurisdiction over the Oil\n Companies\u2019 claims under the Contract Settlement Act of\n 1944 (\u201cCSA\u201d) and, thus, erred in awarding interest under\n the CSA. We disagree with the government on both points\n\fCase: 20-2221      Document: 40      Page: 3     Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n SHELL OIL COMPANY    v.

In doing so, we\n hope to put an end to the government\u2019s continued re-\n sistance to making payments we have found it is obligated\n to make.\n                         I. BACKGROUND\n                    A. The Avgas Contracts\n     During World War II, the United States needed large\n quantities of avgas for use in airplane engines. Avgas be-\n came \u201cthe most critically needed refinery product during\n World War II.\u201d Damages Decision, 896 F.3d at 1303. \u201c[T]he\n Government recognized the need to quickly mobilize avgas\n production . . . stating: \u2018It is essential, in the national inter-\n est that the supplies of all grades of aviation gasoline for\n military, defense and essential civilian uses be increased\n immediately to the maximum.\u2019\u201d Liability Decision, 751\n F.3d at 1286 (emphasis omitted). Accordingly, between\n 1942 and 1943, the government, through the Defense Sup-\n plies Corporation (\u201cDSC\u201d), entered into contracts with the\n Oil Companies to facilitate avgas production (\u201cthe Avgas\n Contracts\u201d).\n     The Avgas Contracts required the Oil Companies to\n rapidly \u201cexpand avgas production facilities\u201d and \u201csell vast\n quantities of avgas\u201d to the government with an artificially\n low profit margin between six and seven percent. Id. at\n 1286 n.3, 1286\u201387. \u201cThe Oil Companies agreed to the\n avgas contracts\u2019 low profits in return for the Government\u2019s\n assumption of certain risks outside of the Oil Companies\u2019\n control.\u201d Id. at 1296. As relevant here, the government\n agreed to reimburse the Oil Companies for \u201cany new or ad-\n ditional taxes, fees, or charges\u201d which the Oil Companies\n \u201cmay be required by any municipal, state, or federal law in\n the United States or any foreign country to collect or pay\n by reason of the production, manufacture, sale or delivery\n of the [avgas].\u201d Id. at 1287.\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40      Page: 4    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 4                                   SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US\n\n\n\n      The Oil Companies\u2019 performance of the Avgas Con-\n tracts helped to increase the country\u2019s avgas production\n from 40,000 barrels a day in December 1941 to 514,000 bar-\n rels a day by 1945. Id. at 1287. It is undisputed that the\n increased avgas production during the war led to increased\n amounts of acid waste. Although there was technology to\n reprocess acid waste, and the Oil Companies did, in fact,\n reprocess much of the waste, there was a massive amount\n of waste that overwhelmed the existing reprocessing facil-\n ities. And, although the Oil Companies asked the govern-\n ment to construct new facilities, the government refused,\n prioritizing avgas production over the transportation of\n acid waste for reprocessing and over the construction of ad-\n ditional reprocessing facilities. Id. at 1288.\n     As a result, the Oil Companies entered into contracts\n with an individual named Eli McColl to dispose of the acid\n waste at what became known as the McColl site in Fuller-\n ton, California. The Oil Companies disposed of acid waste\n at the McColl site from 1942 until shortly after the war\n ended in 1945, when the need for avgas plummeted and the\n government terminated the contracts. Id. \u201cThe McColl site\n closed on September 6, 1946.\u201d Damages Decision, 896 F.3d\n at 1304.\n                   B. The Prior Litigation\n     In 1991, forty-five years after the McColl Site closed,\n the United States and the State of California filed suit\n against the Oil Companies under the Comprehensive En-\n vironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of\n 1980 (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601, et seq., in the United\n States District Court for the Central District of California,\n seeking to require the Oil Companies to pay cleanup costs\n arising from the acid waste generated during World War II\n pursuant to the Avgas Contracts. The Oil Companies coun-\n terclaimed against the United States, asserting that the\n government should be held liable for the CERCLA costs.\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40      Page: 5    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US                                  5\n\n\n\n     The district court first found both the Oil Companies\n and the United States jointly and severally liable. United\n States v. Shell Oil Co., 841 F. Supp. 962, 974\u201375 (C.D. Cal.\n 1993). But the court later allocated all of the cleanup costs\n to the government as an \u201carranger\u201d of the disposal. United\n States v. Shell Oil Co., 13 F. Supp. 2d 1018, 1030 (C.D. Cal.\n 1998).\n     On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district\n court\u2019s decision that the government was 100% liable for\n the cost of cleaning up the benzol waste (which was about\n 5.5% of the waste) at the McColl site, but reversed its deci-\n sion that the government was liable as an \u201carranger\u201d for\n the non-benzol waste. United States v. Shell Oil Co., 294\n F.3d 1045, 1048\u201349 (9th Cir. 2002). Specifically, the court\n found that the government \u201cwas the end purchaser of\n avgas, and was thus more like a customer of the [avgas]\n manufacturers than like the manufacturers themselves.\u201d\n Id. at 1056. Given the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding on \u201car-\n ranger\u201d liability, the Oil Companies have borne nearly all\n of the clean-up costs incurred since 1994.\n     After remand from the Ninth Circuit, the district court\n transferred the Oil Companies\u2019 indemnification counter-\n claims to the Claims Court. The Oil Companies voluntarily\n dismissed the transferred counterclaims without prejudice\n so that they could first exhaust their administrative reme-\n dies. The Oil Companies submitted to the General Services\n Administration (\u201cGSA\u201d) (the successor to DSC) a termina-\n tion claim pursuant to the CSA, seeking reimbursement\n under the Avgas Contracts for environmental remediation\n costs at the McColl site. GSA denied the claim in 2006.\n     On February 24, 2006, the Oil Companies filed suit in\n the Claims Court, seeking reimbursement of the CERCLA\n cleanup costs from the United States. The court granted\n summary judgment in favor of the Oil Companies, finding\n the government liable under the Avgas Contracts for all\n cleanup costs at the McColl site. Shell Oil Co. v. United\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40     Page: 6    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 6                                  SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US\n\n\n\n States, 80 Fed. Cl. 411, 420 (2008). We vacated that judg-\n ment on appeal because the judge to whom the case was\n assigned had a financial conflict of interest. Shell Oil Co.\n v. United States, 672 F.3d 1283, 1290\u201391 (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n     On remand, the case was reassigned, and the Claims\n Court again granted summary judgment in 2013, this time\n in favor of the government. Shell Oil Co. v. United States,\n 108 Fed. Cl. 422, 448 (2013). This court reversed, holding\n that \u201c[t]he plain language of the new or additional charges\n provision thus requires the Government to indemnify the\n Oil Companies for CERCLA costs incurred \u2018by reason of\u2019\n the avgas contracts.\u201d Liability Decision, 751 F.3d at 1293.\n We remanded the case for the Claims Court \u201cto determine\n how much acid waste at the McColl site was \u2018by reason of\u2019\n the avgas contracts.\u201d Id. at 1303.\n     The Claims Court held a trial on damages in early\n 2016. Following that trial, the court found that \u201call of the\n acid waste disposed of at the McColl Site was \u2018by reason of\u2019\n the Avgas Contracts,\u201d and awarded the Oil Companies\n $99,509,847.32 in damages. Shell Oil Co. v. United States,\n 130 Fed. Cl. 8, 34 (2017) (\u201cShell I\u201d). This amount repre-\n sented 100 percent of the costs that the Oil Companies had\n incurred at the McColl site through November 30, 2015,\n plus the interest on those costs through the date of judg-\n ment.\n     In July 2018, we affirmed the Claims Court\u2019s judg-\n ment. The government did not seek rehearing en banc.\n Nor did it petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certio-\n rari. The judgment in favor of the Oil Companies became\n final, and the government paid the Oil Companies in April\n 2019.\n                 C. The Present Litigation\n      Remediation of the McColl site remains ongoing. At\n this stage, the dispute between the parties involves:\n (1) cleanup costs the Oil Companies have continued to\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40     Page: 7   Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US                                7\n\n\n\n incur since November 30, 2015, the end of the period ad-\n dressed in the 2016 damages trial; and (2) interest that\n continues to accrue on those costs. The Oil Companies sub-\n mitted a formal demand for these costs and interest to GSA\n in July 2019, but received no response.\n     On November 22, 2019, the Oil Companies filed this\n action in the Claims Court pursuant to Section 13(c)(2) of\n the CSA, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(c)(2). The complaint alleged that,\n between December 1, 2015 and September 30, 2019, the Oil\n Companies paid an additional $1,543,840.68 to the contrac-\n tor overseeing remediation at the McColl site, and\n $69,300.00 to the contractor providing security at the\n site\u2014a total of $1,613,140.68. J.A. 389. The Oil Compa-\n nies sought reimbursement of those costs as well as inter-\n est accruing through the date of payment pursuant to the\n CSA. 1\n     The Oil Companies moved for summary judgment soon\n after filing the complaint, and the government filed a re-\n sponse and motion to dismiss. On June 29, 2020, the\n Claims Court issued its decision granting both motions in\n part and denying them in part. The court concluded that\n the government was liable under the Avgas Contracts for\n the continuing cleanup costs and that the Oil Companies\n were \u201centitled to indemnification and associated interest\n through the date of payment for remediation costs incurred\n after November 30, 2015 through November 15, 2019,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n    1     The CSA provided that federal agencies shall \u201cpay\n interest on the amount due and unpaid from time to time\n on any termination claim under a prime contract at the\n rate of 2.5 per centum per annum for the period beginning\n thirty days after the date fixed for termination and ending\n with the date of final payment.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(f) (re-\n pealed 2011).\n\fCase: 20-2221     Document: 40      Page: 8     Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 8                                     SHELL OIL COMPANY    v. US\n\n\n\n which remediation costs amounted to approximately $1.6\n million. Shell II, 148 Fed. Cl. at 785, 796. 2\n     In its decision, the Claims Court concluded that res ju-\n dicata did not bar the Oil Companies\u2019 claim for costs in-\n curred after November 30, 2015, and related interest on\n those costs. Id. at 790. The court agreed with the Oil Com-\n panies that their claims were \u201cnot barred by res judicata\n because they fall within a partial breach exception to gen-\n eral claim preclusion principles.\u201d Id. As the court ex-\n plained, \u201cthe general rule is that when one party has\n performed its duties under a contract and the other party\u2019s\n obligations are ongoing, a breach by the latter party must\n be considered partial.\u201d Id. at 791. Applying this principle,\n the court determined that \u201cthe oil companies\u2019 initial law-\n suit must be classified as a suit for partial, not total, breach\n insofar as it sought indemnification for past cleanup costs\n at the McColl site.\u201d Id. Specifically, the Claims Court ex-\n plained that, \u201cwhen \u2018[t]he [g]overnment breached its con-\n tract 60 years after the [o]il [c]ompanies had finished\n performing under the [a]vgas [c]ontracts,\u2019 they stood \u2018in the\n position of an annuitant or a creditor exacting payment\n from a debtor\u2019 and as such were \u2018compelled to wait for the\n installments as they severally mature.\u2019\u201d Id.\n     The Claims Court rejected the government\u2019s argument\n that \u201cthe oil companies cannot now characterize the prior\n claims as claims for a partial breach when they originally\n elected to plead a total breach, thereby merging their de-\n mands for future damages into the judgment awarding\n\n\n     2    The Oil Companies also sought approximately $5.7\n million in post-judgment interest \u201caccrued through the\n date of payment on the charges awarded\u201d in Shell I. Shell\n II, 148 Fed. Cl. at 792. The Claims Court held that the Oil\n Companies were not entitled to that interest because they\n failed to seek it in Shell I. Id. at 792\u201393. The Oil Compa-\n nies have not appealed that decision.\n\fCase: 20-2221     Document: 40      Page: 9    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US                                    9\n\n\n\n past damages.\u201d Id. The court explained that, \u201ceven if the\n oil companies in their complaint in the prior action had\n sought future costs, plaintiffs could not effectively elect to\n treat their claims for future costs as part of a total breach.\u201d\n Id. Indeed, \u201ccontract law precludes recovery for specula-\n tive damages,\u201d and \u201can attempt by the oil companies at the\n time of the first suit to project future costs they might (or\n might not) incur\u201d could only be described as speculative.\n Id. (citation omitted). As such, the court concluded that\n \u201cthose claims for speculative future damages did not merge\n into the judgment rendered but were simply put aside and\n not reflected in, or addressed by, the judgment.\u201d Id.\n     Next, the Claims Court held that it had jurisdiction un-\n der the CSA (and thus could award interest provided under\n that statute) notwithstanding the partial repeal of the CSA\n in 2011, \u201cbecause the rights and duties of the parties had\n matured before\u201d the repeal. Id. at 793. In doing so, the\n court rejected the government\u2019s argument that any \u201cduties\u201d\n it may have had could not have \u201cmatured\u201d until the Oil\n Companies submitted their formal claim for reimburse-\n ment in 2019.\n     The court held that:\n     [u]nder the plain language of the agreements, the\n     government\u2019s duty to pay any new or additional\n     charges the oil companies incurred by reason of the\n     production of avgas was not contingent on the oil\n     companies\u2019 act of seeking reimbursement, but in-\n     stead upon their incurrence of new liabilities dic-\n     tated by federal law. The agreements thus indicate\n     that the government\u2019s duty to pay arose at what-\n     ever time the oil companies became liable to pay\n     charges required by CERCLA due to their produc-\n     tion of avgas\u2014and both parties agree that that\n     happened, at the latest, when the oil companies\n     were found liable for remediation at the McColl site\n     in the 1990s, well before the CSA\u2019s repeal. That no\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40      Page: 10    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 10                                   SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US\n\n\n\n      breach could occur until the oil companies de-\n      manded performance is irrelevant to whether the\n      government previously had an existing duty to\n      eventually perform.\n Id. at 794.\n     The Claims Court therefore concluded that the Oil\n Companies were entitled to indemnification for remedia-\n tion costs incurred at the McColl site from November 30,\n 2015 through September 30, 2019, plus interest on such\n costs, accruing through the date of final payment, at the\n rate and terms specified in 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(f). Id. at 796\u2013\n 97.\n    The government timely appealed. We have jurisdiction\n pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).\n                        II. DISCUSSION\n     We review a Claims Court decision granting summary\n judgment de novo. 1st Home Liquidating Trust v. United\n States, 581 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Summary\n judgment is appropriate if, when viewing the evidence in\n the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the record\n indicates that there is \u201cno genuine issue as to any material\n fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\n matter of law.\u201d Id. (quoting R. Ct. Fed. Cl. 56(c); Fed. R.\n Civ. P. 56(c)).\n     On appeal, the government argues that the Claims\n Court made two reversible errors. First, the government\n argues that the court erred when it \u201cfailed to apply res ju-\n dicata to redundant costs in this case (Shell II) that the oil\n companies sought in their 2005 administrative claim.\u201d Ap-\n pellant\u2019s Br. 11. Second, the government maintains that\n the court misinterpreted the savings clause of the CSA\u2019s\n repealer statute. According to the government, the court\n should have found that \u201cthe long-repealed CSA did not ap-\n ply because no \u2018rights and duties\u2019 had \u2018matured\u2019 as of the\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40      Page: 11    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US                                  11\n\n\n\n effective date of the CSA\u2019s repeal.\u201d Id. We address each\n issue in turn.\n                       A. Res Judicata\n     \u201cUnder res judicata, a final judgment on the merits of\n an action precludes the parties or their privies from reliti-\n gating issues that were or could have been raised in that\n action.\u201d Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980) (citing\n Cromwell v. County of Sac., 94 U.S. 351, 352 (1876)). Res\n judicata applies where \u201c(1) there is identity of parties (or\n their privies); (2) there has been an earlier final judgment\n on the merits of a claim; and (3) the second claim is based\n on the same set of transactional facts as the first.\u201d Levi\n Strauss & Co. v. Abercrombie & Fitch Trading Co., 719\n F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \u201cThe doctrine of res judi-\n cata rests at bottom upon the ground that the party to be\n affected . . . has litigated or had an opportunity to litigate\n the same matter in a former action in a court of competent\n jurisdiction.\u201d Richards v. Jefferson Cty., 517 U.S. 793, 797\n n.4 (1996). A judgment is generally res judicata \u201cnot only\n as to all matters litigated and decided by it, but as to all\n relevant issues which could have been but were not raised\n and litigated in the suit.\u201d Heiser v. Woodruff, 327 U.S. 726,\n 735 (1946).\n     We have recognized a partial breach exception to gen-\n eral claim preclusion principles. Indiana Michigan Power\n Co. v. United States, 422 F.3d 1369, 1377\u201378 (Fed. Cir.\n 2005). Where a breach is partial, \u201cthe injured party may\n recover damages for nonperformance only to the time of\n trial and may not recover damages for anticipated future\n nonperformance.\u201d Id. at 1376. That is so because \u201cprospec-\n tive damages for anticipated future nonperformance re-\n sulting from the same partial breach\u201d are \u201chighly\n speculative,\u201d and contract law precludes recovery for spec-\n ulative damages. Id. Accordingly, we have held that,\n \u201c[w]hen a party sues for partial breach, it retains its right\n to sue for damages for its remaining rights to\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40      Page: 12     Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 12                                   SHELL OIL COMPANY    v. US\n\n\n\n performance.\u201d Id. at 1377. That is, \u201cin a case involving a\n continuing or recurrent wrong,\u201d \u201c[a] judgment in an action\n for breach of contract does not normally preclude the plain-\n tiff from thereafter maintaining an action for breaches of\n the same contract that consist of failure to render perfor-\n mance due after commencement of the first action.\u201d Id.\n (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 26, cmt. g).\n     Here, the Claims Court noted that, \u201cwhen one party\n has performed its duties under a contract and the other\n party\u2019s obligations are ongoing, a breach by the latter party\n must be considered partial.\u201d Shell II, 148 Fed. Cl. at 791.\n The court explained that \u201cthe oil companies\u2019 initial lawsuit\n must be classified as a suit for partial, not total, breach in-\n sofar as it sought indemnification for past cleanup costs at\n the McColl site.\u201d Id. And, as noted, the court rejected the\n government\u2019s argument that \u201cthe oil companies cannot now\n characterize the prior claims as claims for a partial breach\n when they originally elected to plead a total breach,\n thereby merging their demands for future damages into\n the judgment awarding past damages.\u201d Id.\n      On appeal, the government argues that, in Shell I, the\n Oil Companies \u201csought, among other past and future costs,\n the exact same future costs at issue in this case.\u201d Appel-\n lant\u2019s Br. 11. According to the government, because the\n Shell I court asserted jurisdiction over the entire complaint\n and issued a final judgment, \u201cany future costs that the oil\n companies were seeking were either contained in that judg-\n ment or, specifically regarding the future costs the oil com-\n panies currently seek, were extinguished when the Shell I\n judgment became final.\u201d Id. at 11\u201312. The government\n maintains that the dispositive question is not whether the\n future costs claimed in Shell I were viable, but whether\n they were asserted in the complaint and not dismissed with\n prejudice before judgment. Specifically, it argues that,\n \u201c[a]lthough the oil companies ultimately did not seek recov-\n ery for the future cost claims in Shell I, they never sought\n to dismiss them voluntarily, and the court entered a final\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40      Page: 13     Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US                                   13\n\n\n\n judgment for a sum certain that provided no basis to con-\n clude that it was dismissing those abandoned claims with-\n out prejudice, which would be required to escape res\n judicata.\u201d Id. at 19.\n      The government\u2019s arguments on appeal are overly\n technical and ultimately unpersuasive. As an initial mat-\n ter, it is worth noting what the government is not arguing.\n The government does not deny that its breach was partial.\n Nor does it suggest that the Oil Companies could have re-\n covered the costs in this action in the prior Shell I litiga-\n tion. Instead, the government takes the position that,\n regardless of whether the Claims Court could have\n awarded future damages in Shell I, any claims for such\n damages are now barred because the Oil Companies in-\n cluded a request for future damages in their Shell I com-\n plaint. We disagree.\n     First, it is worth noting that, despite the government\u2019s\n description of the complaint in Shell I, the Oil Companies\n never expressly asked for all future damages or alleged an-\n ything other than a partial breach. J.A. 101\u201302. The gov-\n ernment claims that fact is of no moment because the Oil\n Companies\u2019 administrative claim included an estimate for\n future costs and requested a determination that the gov-\n ernment would pay for costs incurred in the future. See\n J.A. 29. The fact that a party seeks final resolution of an\n ongoing dispute in an administrative filing does not mean\n that the actual complaint filed in court bars future claims\n on res judicata grounds, however.\n      Second, as the Claims Court correctly explained, \u201ceven\n if the oil companies in their complaint in the prior action\n had sought future costs, plaintiffs could not effectively elect\n to treat their claims for future costs as part of a total\n breach.\u201d Shell II, 148 Fed. Cl. at 791. Because contract\n law precludes recovery for speculative damages, the \u201cmere\n fact that plaintiffs asserted those claims in their complaint\n in the first case did not make them viable claims.\u201d Id.\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40     Page: 14    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 14                                  SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US\n\n\n\n Accordingly, we agree with the Claims Court that any\n claims for future speculative damages \u201cdid not merge into\n the judgment rendered but were simply put aside and not\n reflected in, or addressed by, the judgment.\u201d Id.\n      The partial breach doctrine makes clear that damages\n that could not have been sought in a prior action because\n they had not yet accrued may be sought in a subsequent\n action. Indiana Michigan, 422 F.3d at 1377. As the Claims\n Court correctly explained, \u201cthe general rule is that when\n one party has performed its duties under a contract and the\n other party\u2019s obligations are ongoing, a breach by the latter\n party must be considered partial.\u201d Shell II, 148 Fed. Cl. at\n 791. And, because the government breached the Avgas\n Contracts decades after the Oil Companies finished perfor-\n mance, the Oil Companies \u201cstood \u2018in the position of an an-\n nuitant or a creditor exacting payment from a debtor\u2019 and\n as such were \u2018compelled to wait for the installments as they\n severally mature.\u2019\u201d Id. For these reasons, we agree with\n the Claims Court that the partial breach doctrine was ap-\n plicable here, notwithstanding the Oil Companies\u2019 request\n for future damages in Shell I.\n     The government argues that the Claims Court\u2019s reli-\n ance on Indiana Michigan was misplaced because there,\n the plaintiff sued for partial breach in the complaint. Ap-\n pellant\u2019s Br. 17. In that case, which involved the govern-\n ment\u2019s breach of a standard contract for the disposal of\n spent nuclear fuel, Indiana Michigan sued the government,\n seeking both pre-breach mitigation costs and future dam-\n ages. Indiana Michigan, 422 F.3d at 1371\u201372. The Claims\n Court denied Indiana Michigan\u2019s claimed damages, hold-\n ing that, because Indiana Michigan claimed partial versus\n total breach, recovery for pre-breach mitigation costs and\n present recovery for future damages was precluded. Id. at\n 1373. On appeal, we held that Indiana Michigan\u2019s claim\n was for partial breach. We explained that, while \u201c[f]uture\n damages could have been awarded had Indiana Michigan\n claimed total breach,\u201d \u201c[i]f the breach is partial only, the\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40      Page: 15    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US                                  15\n\n\n\n injured party may recover damages for nonperformance\n only to the time of trial and may not recover damages for\n anticipated future nonperformance.\u201d Id. at 1376.\n      We then clarified how res judicata applies in the partial\n breach context. Noting that the government \u201cagreed . . .\n that Indiana Michigan [could] maintain future suits,\u201d we\n held that, \u201c[i]f the breach of an entire contract is only par-\n tial, the plaintiff can recover only such damages as he or\n she has sustained, leaving prospective damages to a later\n suit in the event of further breaches.\u201d Id. at 1377 (quoting\n 22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages \u00a7 488 (2003)). Therefore, under\n Indiana Michigan, if a plaintiff brings a claim for partial\n breach, res judicata does not bar subsequent lawsuits to\n recover future damages for further breaching acts. Id.\n     While Indiana Michigan did not involve the exact same\n procedural posture as this case, it demonstrates that the\n partial breach doctrine applies to contract claims like the\n one here, and that subsequent partial breach claims will\n not be precluded by res judicata. We have consistently ap-\n plied this principle, reiterating that a subsequent suit \u201cis\n not barred by claim preclusion\u2014regardless of whether the\n same transactional facts are present in both suits\u2014to the\n extent [the party\u2019s] allegations are temporally limited to\n acts occurring after final judgment was entered in the first\n suit.\u201d Brain Life, LLC v. Elekta Inc., 746 F.3d 1045, 1054\n (Fed. Cir. 2014).\n     The bottom line is that a plaintiff cannot be precluded\n from bringing a claim that was unavailable in the first ac-\n tion\u2014either because the breach was partial or because the\n conduct at issue had not yet occurred at the time of the first\n suit. See Lawlor v. Nat\u2019l Screen Serv. Corp., 349 U.S. 322,\n 328 (1955) (explaining that a prior judgment \u201ccannot be\n given the effect of extinguishing claims which did not even\n then exist and which could not possibly have been sued\n upon in the previous case\u201d). This is true regardless of the\n relief sought in the first action. See id. (finding that the\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40      Page: 16     Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 16                                   SHELL OIL COMPANY    v. US\n\n\n\n prior suit did not bar the second, even though the first com-\n plaint sought \u201cinjunctive relief which, if granted, would\n have prevented the illegal acts\u201d plaintiffs complained of in\n the second suit). The government\u2019s arguments to the con-\n trary are inconsistent with settled res judicata principles.\n We therefore agree with the Claims Court that the Oil\n Companies\u2019 successive partial breach claim was not barred\n by res judicata.\n                         B. The CSA\n      In 2011, Congress repealed the CSA. The government\n maintains that this repeal deprived the Claims Court of ju-\n risdiction to hear the Oil Companies\u2019 CSA claims, which\n were filed in 2019. According to the government, the Oil\n Companies should have filed suit under the Contract Dis-\n putes Act or the Tucker Act. 3 But Congress\u2019s repeal of the\n CSA included a savings clause: \u201cThe laws specified in the\n following schedule are repealed, except for rights and du-\n ties that matured, penalties that were incurred, and pro-\n ceedings that were begun before the date of enactment of\n\n\n      3   The government acknowledges that the Oil Compa-\n nies could have filed suit under Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 1491(a)(1), and does not object to the trial court\u2019s exercise\n of jurisdiction over the Oil Companies\u2019 claims for cost reim-\n bursement, except on res judicata grounds. Appellant\u2019s Br.\n 11, n.2. The question of whether the Claims Court had ju-\n risdiction under the CSA is important, however, because\n the interest award to the Oil Companies was authorized by\n the CSA, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(f), and interest is not available\n under the Tucker Act. See Richlin Sec. Serv. Co. v.\n Chertoff, 437 F.3d 1296, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (\u201cThe Su-\n preme Court has long held that \u2018interest cannot be recov-\n ered in a suit against the \u2018[G]overnment in the absence of\n an express waiver of sovereign immunity from an award of\n interest.\u2019\u201d (quoting Libr. of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U.S. 310,\n 311 (1986)).\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40     Page: 17    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US                                 17\n\n\n\n this Act.\u201d Pub. L. 111-350, 124 Stat. 3677, 3855 (Jan. 4,\n 2011). The parties dispute whether the savings clause ap-\n plies to preserve the Oil Companies\u2019 CSA claims. Resolu-\n tion of this issue turns on whether the rights and duties of\n the parties matured before the repealing statute was en-\n acted. The Claims Court found that they did. We agree.\n     The Oil Companies\u2019 rights at issue and the govern-\n ment\u2019s corresponding duties stem from the indemnification\n provision in the Avgas Contracts. That provision provides\n that the government must pay \u201cany new or additional\n taxes, fees, or charges\u201d which the Oil Companies \u201cmay be\n required by any municipal, state, or federal law in the\n United States or any foreign country to collect or pay by\n reason of the production, manufacture, sale or delivery of\n [avgas].\u201d Shell II, 148 Fed. Cl. at 785\u201386 (emphasis in orig-\n inal). Under this provision, the Oil Companies had a right\n to reimbursement and the government had a correspond-\n ing duty to indemnify. Id. at 794.\n     As the Claims Court explained, \u201c[t]he contracts did not\n specify a precise time for performance.\u201d Id. Nor could they,\n given the \u201cunforeseeable nature of the costs\u201d contemplated.\n Id. But the Avgas Contracts make clear that the govern-\n ment has a duty to indemnify the Oil Companies when a\n \u201cfederal law\u201d \u201crequired\u201d the companies \u201cto . . . pay\u201d \u201cnew or\n additional . . . charges\u201d \u201cby reason of the production of\u201d\n avgas. Id. at 785\u201386. Given this language, we agree with\n the Claims Court that the government\u2019s duty to indemnify\n was triggered, at the latest, when the Oil Companies were\n found liable under CERCLA due to their production of\n avgas. Id. at 794. It is undisputed that this occurred in\n the 1990s, \u201cwell before the CSA\u2019s repeal.\u201d Id.\n     On appeal, the government argues that, under the\n CSA\u2019s mandatory administrative claims process, it \u201chad no\n duty to pay the oil companies\u2019 claims until they presented\n their termination claim to GSA in 2019.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br.\n 22\u201323. According to the government, because the Oil\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40     Page: 18    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 18                                  SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US\n\n\n\n Companies had no \u201cright\u201d to sue under the CSA until they\n exhausted their administrative remedies, no \u201cduty\u201d to pay\n matured until after 2011. Id. at 23. We disagree.\n     The government seems to be drawing a distinction be-\n tween its contractual duty to indemnify the Oil Companies\n under the Avgas Contracts\u2014which is the relevant duty for\n purposes of the CSA\u2019s savings clause\u2014and its CSA duty to\n resolve a termination claim submitted under that statute.\n Appellant\u2019s Br. 24. As the Claims Court explained, how-\n ever, \u201c[t]he CSA does not dictate when the rights and du-\n ties defined in a contract mature for purposes of the\n savings clause in the repealing statute; rather, it defines a\n set of procedural rules that are unrelated to the substan-\n tive legal obligations arising under an independent con-\n tractual agreement like the one here.\u201d Shell II, 148 Fed.\n Cl. at 795.\n     Under the terms of the Avgas Contracts, \u201cthe govern-\n ment\u2019s duty to pay any new or additional charges the oil\n companies incurred by reason of the production of avgas\n was not contingent on the oil companies\u2019 act of seeking re-\n imbursement, but instead upon their incurrence of new li-\n abilities dictated by federal law.\u201d Id. at 794. The\n government\u2019s contractual duties, within the meaning of the\n savings clause, matured (at the latest) when the Oil Com-\n panies were held liable under CERCLA to pay environmen-\n tal remediation costs at the McColl site. If Congress had\n meant to limit the savings clause to claims that had been\n presented to the agency prior to the repeal, it could have\n done so. Instead, the savings clause preserves claims\n based on when the claimant\u2019s rights and the government\u2019s\n duties matured. Here, the plain language of the Avgas\n Contracts indicates that the government\u2019s duty to indem-\n nify matured in tandem with the Oil Companies\u2019 liability\n under CERCLA.\n    The government cites Tektel, Inc. v. United States, 121\n Fed. Cl. 680 (2015), for the proposition that it had no duty\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40      Page: 19     Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US                                   19\n\n\n\n to indemnify the Oil Companies until they exhausted the\n CSA\u2019s procedure. But in Tektel, which is not binding on\n this court, the contract specifically required the plaintiff to\n exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial\n review. Id. at 686. As such, Tektel\u2019s right to seek judicial\n relief could not have matured until it had exhausted its ad-\n ministrative remedies, because those remedies were part\n of the contract. Here, nothing in the Avgas Contracts re-\n quires the Oil Companies to comply with the CSA\u2019s proce-\n dures\u2014let alone requires them to do so before they are\n entitled to indemnification. Notably, the CSA was not en-\n acted until years after the Oil Companies entered into the\n Avgas Contracts.\n      The government also submits that, under G.L. Chris-\n tian & Associates v. United States, 312 F.2d 418 (Ct. Cl.\n 1963), statutory and regulatory provisions must be deemed\n included within government contracts by law if they are:\n (1) required; and (2) involve a \u201cdeeply ingrained strand\u201d of\n procurement policy. Appellant\u2019s Br. 26 (quoting Gen. Eng\u2019g\n & Mach. Works v. O\u2019Keefe, 991 F.2d 775, 779 (Fed. Cir.\n 1993)). We have recognized that \u201cChristian stands for the\n proposition that if the parties to a government contract ne-\n glect to include a clause in the contract that is otherwise\n required by regulation . . . courts will read the clause into\n the contract as a matter of law.\u201d Rockies Exp. Pipeline LLC\n v. Salazar, 730 F.3d 1330, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing\n Christian, 312 F.2d at 426\u201327). The government cites no\n authority establishing that exhaustion requirements were\n mandatory in government war contracts at the time of the\n Avgas Contracts. And nothing suggests that the CSA man-\n dated its procedures retroactively into the Avgas Con-\n tracts. Accordingly, we find that Christian does not apply.\n     We agree with the Claims Court that the government\u2019s\n duty to indemnify the Oil Companies and the Oil Compa-\n nies\u2019 right to reimbursement for remediation costs under\n the Avgas Contracts both matured well before the repealer\n statute\u2019s enactment. The Claims Court therefore correctly\n\fCase: 20-2221   Document: 40    Page: 20    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 20                                SHELL OIL COMPANY   v.

CONCLUSION\n    We have considered the government\u2019s remaining argu-\n ments and find them unpersuasive. For the foregoing rea-\n sons, we affirm the Claims Court\u2019s decision.\n                       AFFIRMED\n\f",

US\n\n\n\n Before NEWMAN, O\u2019MALLEY, and TARANTO, Circuit Judges.\n O\u2019MALLEY, Circuit Judge.\n     This case has been before us on four prior occasions. At\n issue is the government\u2019s obligation under World War II-\n era contracts to indemnify Shell Oil Company; Atlantic\n Richfield Company; Texaco, Inc.; and Union Oil Company\n of California (collectively, \u201cthe Oil Companies\u201d) for environ-\n mental remediation costs they incurred due to their pro-\n duction of aviation gasoline (\u201cavgas\u201d) for the war effort.

United States, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">751\n F.3d 1282<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1293 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (\u201cLiability Decision\u201d).

Consistent with those decisions, in 2019, the gov-\n ernment reimbursed the Oil Companies for the\n remediation costs incurred through November 2015, and\n interest thereon.\n     Because remediation efforts remain ongoing, the Oil\n Companies filed suit in the United States Court of Federal\n Claims (\u201cClaims Court\u201d), seeking damages for additional\n remediation costs incurred between November 2015 and\n November 2019, and for interest related to those costs. The\n Claims Court found the government liable for remediation\n costs incurred from November 30, 2015 through September\n 30, 2019, as well as interest accruing through the date of\n final payment.

In doing so, we\n hope to put an end to the government\u2019s continued re-\n sistance to making payments we have found it is obligated\n to make.\n                         I. BACKGROUND\n                    A. The Avgas Contracts\n     During World War II, the United States needed large\n quantities of avgas for use in airplane engines. Avgas be-\n came \u201cthe most critically needed refinery product during\n World War II.\u201d Damages Decision, 896 F.3d at 1303. \u201c[T]he\n Government recognized the need to quickly mobilize avgas\n production . . . stating: \u2018It is essential, in the national inter-\n est that the supplies of all grades of aviation gasoline for\n military, defense and essential civilian uses be increased\n immediately to the maximum.\u2019\u201d Liability Decision, 751\n F.3d at 1286 (emphasis omitted). Accordingly, between\n 1942 and 1943, the government, through the Defense Sup-\n plies Corporation (\u201cDSC\u201d), entered into contracts with the\n Oil Companies to facilitate avgas production (\u201cthe Avgas\n Contracts\u201d).\n     The Avgas Contracts required the Oil Companies to\n rapidly \u201cexpand avgas production facilities\u201d and \u201csell vast\n quantities of avgas\u201d to the government with an artificially\n low profit margin between six and seven percent. Id. at\n 1286 n.3, 1286\u201387. \u201cThe Oil Companies agreed to the\n avgas contracts\u2019 low profits in return for the Government\u2019s\n assumption of certain risks outside of the Oil Companies\u2019\n control.\u201d Id. at 1296. As relevant here, the government\n agreed to reimburse the Oil Companies for \u201cany new or ad-\n ditional taxes, fees, or charges\u201d which the Oil Companies\n \u201cmay be required by any municipal, state, or federal law in\n the United States or any foreign country to collect or pay\n by reason of the production, manufacture, sale or delivery\n of the [avgas].\u201d Id. at 1287.\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40      Page: 4    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 4                                   SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US\n\n\n\n      The Oil Companies\u2019 performance of the Avgas Con-\n tracts helped to increase the country\u2019s avgas production\n from 40,000 barrels a day in December 1941 to 514,000 bar-\n rels a day by 1945. Id. at 1287. It is undisputed that the\n increased avgas production during the war led to increased\n amounts of acid waste. Although there was technology to\n reprocess acid waste, and the Oil Companies did, in fact,\n reprocess much of the waste, there was a massive amount\n of waste that overwhelmed the existing reprocessing facil-\n ities. And, although the Oil Companies asked the govern-\n ment to construct new facilities, the government refused,\n prioritizing avgas production over the transportation of\n acid waste for reprocessing and over the construction of ad-\n ditional reprocessing facilities. Id. at 1288.\n     As a result, the Oil Companies entered into contracts\n with an individual named Eli McColl to dispose of the acid\n waste at what became known as the McColl site in Fuller-\n ton, California. The Oil Companies disposed of acid waste\n at the McColl site from 1942 until shortly after the war\n ended in 1945, when the need for avgas plummeted and the\n government terminated the contracts. Id. \u201cThe McColl site\n closed on September 6, 1946.\u201d Damages Decision, 896 F.3d\n at 1304.\n                   B. The Prior Litigation\n     In 1991, forty-five years after the McColl Site closed,\n the United States and the State of California filed suit\n against the Oil Companies under the Comprehensive En-\n vironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of\n 1980 (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601, et seq., in the United\n States District Court for the Central District of California,\n seeking to require the Oil Companies to pay cleanup costs\n arising from the acid waste generated during World War II\n pursuant to the Avgas Contracts. The Oil Companies coun-\n terclaimed against the United States, asserting that the\n government should be held liable for the CERCLA costs.\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40      Page: 5    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n SHELL OIL COMPANY   v.

Given the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding on \u201car-\n ranger\u201d liability, the Oil Companies have borne nearly all\n of the clean-up costs incurred since 1994.\n     After remand from the Ninth Circuit, the district court\n transferred the Oil Companies\u2019 indemnification counter-\n claims to the Claims Court. The Oil Companies voluntarily\n dismissed the transferred counterclaims without prejudice\n so that they could first exhaust their administrative reme-\n dies. The Oil Companies submitted to the General Services\n Administration (\u201cGSA\u201d) (the successor to DSC) a termina-\n tion claim pursuant to the CSA, seeking reimbursement\n under the Avgas Contracts for environmental remediation\n costs at the McColl site. GSA denied the claim in 2006.\n     On February 24, 2006, the Oil Companies filed suit in\n the Claims Court, seeking reimbursement of the CERCLA\n cleanup costs from the United States.

Following that trial, the court found that \u201call of the\n acid waste disposed of at the McColl Site was \u2018by reason of\u2019\n the Avgas Contracts,\u201d and awarded the Oil Companies\n $99,509,847.32 in damages.

This amount repre-\n sented 100 percent of the costs that the Oil Companies had\n incurred at the McColl site through November 30, 2015,\n plus the interest on those costs through the date of judg-\n ment.\n     In July 2018, we affirmed the Claims Court\u2019s judg-\n ment. The government did not seek rehearing en banc.\n Nor did it petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certio-\n rari. The judgment in favor of the Oil Companies became\n final, and the government paid the Oil Companies in April\n 2019.\n                 C. The Present Litigation\n      Remediation of the McColl site remains ongoing. At\n this stage, the dispute between the parties involves:\n (1) cleanup costs the Oil Companies have continued to\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40     Page: 7   Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n SHELL OIL COMPANY   v.

The Oil Companies sub-\n mitted a formal demand for these costs and interest to GSA\n in July 2019, but received no response.\n     On November 22, 2019, the Oil Companies filed this\n action in the Claims Court pursuant to Section 13(c)(2) of\n the CSA, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(c)(2). The complaint alleged that,\n between December 1, 2015 and September 30, 2019, the Oil\n Companies paid an additional $1,543,840.68 to the contrac-\n tor overseeing remediation at the McColl site, and\n $69,300.00 to the contractor providing security at the\n site\u2014a total of $1,613,140.68. J.A. 389. The Oil Compa-\n nies sought reimbursement of those costs as well as inter-\n est accruing through the date of payment pursuant to the\n CSA. 1\n     The Oil Companies moved for summary judgment soon\n after filing the complaint, and the government filed a re-\n sponse and motion to dismiss. On June 29, 2020, the\n Claims Court issued its decision granting both motions in\n part and denying them in part. The court concluded that\n the government was liable under the Avgas Contracts for\n the continuing cleanup costs and that the Oil Companies\n were \u201centitled to indemnification and associated interest\n through the date of payment for remediation costs incurred\n after November 30, 2015 through November 15, 2019,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n    1     The CSA provided that federal agencies shall \u201cpay\n interest on the amount due and unpaid from time to time\n on any termination claim under a prime contract at the\n rate of 2.5 per centum per annum for the period beginning\n thirty days after the date fixed for termination and ending\n with the date of final payment.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(f) (re-\n pealed 2011).\n\fCase: 20-2221     Document: 40      Page: 8     Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 8                                     SHELL OIL COMPANY    v. US\n\n\n\n which remediation costs amounted to approximately $1.6\n million. Shell II, 148 Fed. Cl. at 785, 796. 2\n     In its decision, the Claims Court concluded that res ju-\n dicata did not bar the Oil Companies\u2019 claim for costs in-\n curred after November 30, 2015, and related interest on\n those costs. Id. at 790. The court agreed with the Oil Com-\n panies that their claims were \u201cnot barred by res judicata\n because they fall within a partial breach exception to gen-\n eral claim preclusion principles.\u201d Id. As the court ex-\n plained, \u201cthe general rule is that when one party has\n performed its duties under a contract and the other party\u2019s\n obligations are ongoing, a breach by the latter party must\n be considered partial.\u201d Id. at 791. Applying this principle,\n the court determined that \u201cthe oil companies\u2019 initial law-\n suit must be classified as a suit for partial, not total, breach\n insofar as it sought indemnification for past cleanup costs\n at the McColl site.\u201d Id. Specifically, the Claims Court ex-\n plained that, \u201cwhen \u2018[t]he [g]overnment breached its con-\n tract 60 years after the [o]il [c]ompanies had finished\n performing under the [a]vgas [c]ontracts,\u2019 they stood \u2018in the\n position of an annuitant or a creditor exacting payment\n from a debtor\u2019 and as such were \u2018compelled to wait for the\n installments as they severally mature.\u2019\u201d Id.\n     The Claims Court rejected the government\u2019s argument\n that \u201cthe oil companies cannot now characterize the prior\n claims as claims for a partial breach when they originally\n elected to plead a total breach, thereby merging their de-\n mands for future damages into the judgment awarding\n\n\n     2    The Oil Companies also sought approximately $5.7\n million in post-judgment interest \u201caccrued through the\n date of payment on the charges awarded\u201d in Shell I. Shell\n II, 148 Fed. Cl. at 792. The Claims Court held that the Oil\n Companies were not entitled to that interest because they\n failed to seek it in Shell I. Id. at 792\u201393. The Oil Compa-\n nies have not appealed that decision.\n\fCase: 20-2221     Document: 40      Page: 9    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n SHELL OIL COMPANY   v.

The court explained that, \u201ceven if the\n oil companies in their complaint in the prior action had\n sought future costs, plaintiffs could not effectively elect to\n treat their claims for future costs as part of a total breach.\u201d\n Id. Indeed, \u201ccontract law precludes recovery for specula-\n tive damages,\u201d and \u201can attempt by the oil companies at the\n time of the first suit to project future costs they might (or\n might not) incur\u201d could only be described as speculative.\n Id.

As such, the court concluded that\n \u201cthose claims for speculative future damages did not merge\n into the judgment rendered but were simply put aside and\n not reflected in, or addressed by, the judgment.\u201d Id.\n     Next, the Claims Court held that it had jurisdiction un-\n der the CSA (and thus could award interest provided under\n that statute) notwithstanding the partial repeal of the CSA\n in 2011, \u201cbecause the rights and duties of the parties had\n matured before\u201d the repeal. Id. at 793. In doing so, the\n court rejected the government\u2019s argument that any \u201cduties\u201d\n it may have had could not have \u201cmatured\u201d until the Oil\n Companies submitted their formal claim for reimburse-\n ment in 2019.\n     The court held that:\n     [u]nder the plain language of the agreements, the\n     government\u2019s duty to pay any new or additional\n     charges the oil companies incurred by reason of the\n     production of avgas was not contingent on the oil\n     companies\u2019 act of seeking reimbursement, but in-\n     stead upon their incurrence of new liabilities dic-\n     tated by federal law. The agreements thus indicate\n     that the government\u2019s duty to pay arose at what-\n     ever time the oil companies became liable to pay\n     charges required by CERCLA due to their produc-\n     tion of avgas\u2014and both parties agree that that\n     happened, at the latest, when the oil companies\n     were found liable for remediation at the McColl site\n     in the 1990s, well before the CSA\u2019s repeal.

As an initial mat-\n ter, it is worth noting what the government is not arguing.\n The government does not deny that its breach was partial.\n Nor does it suggest that the Oil Companies could have re-\n covered the costs in this action in the prior Shell I litiga-\n tion. Instead, the government takes the position that,\n regardless of whether the Claims Court could have\n awarded future damages in Shell I, any claims for such\n damages are now barred because the Oil Companies in-\n cluded a request for future damages in their Shell I com-\n plaint. We disagree.\n     First, it is worth noting that, despite the government\u2019s\n description of the complaint in Shell I, the Oil Companies\n never expressly asked for all future damages or alleged an-\n ything other than a partial breach. J.A. 101\u201302. The gov-\n ernment claims that fact is of no moment because the Oil\n Companies\u2019 administrative claim included an estimate for\n future costs and requested a determination that the gov-\n ernment would pay for costs incurred in the future. See\n J.A. 29. The fact that a party seeks final resolution of an\n ongoing dispute in an administrative filing does not mean\n that the actual complaint filed in court bars future claims\n on res judicata grounds, however.\n      Second, as the Claims Court correctly explained, \u201ceven\n if the oil companies in their complaint in the prior action\n had sought future costs, plaintiffs could not effectively elect\n to treat their claims for future costs as part of a total\n breach.\u201d Shell II, 148 Fed.

We agree.\n     The Oil Companies\u2019 rights at issue and the govern-\n ment\u2019s corresponding duties stem from the indemnification\n provision in the Avgas Contracts. That provision provides\n that the government must pay \u201cany new or additional\n taxes, fees, or charges\u201d which the Oil Companies \u201cmay be\n required by any municipal, state, or federal law in the\n United States or any foreign country to collect or pay by\n reason of the production, manufacture, sale or delivery of\n [avgas].\u201d Shell II, 148 Fed. Cl. at 785\u201386 (emphasis in orig-\n inal). Under this provision, the Oil Companies had a right\n to reimbursement and the government had a correspond-\n ing duty to indemnify. Id. at 794.\n     As the Claims Court explained, \u201c[t]he contracts did not\n specify a precise time for performance.\u201d Id. Nor could they,\n given the \u201cunforeseeable nature of the costs\u201d contemplated.\n Id. But the Avgas Contracts make clear that the govern-\n ment has a duty to indemnify the Oil Companies when a\n \u201cfederal law\u201d \u201crequired\u201d the companies \u201cto . . . pay\u201d \u201cnew or\n additional . . . charges\u201d \u201cby reason of the production of\u201d\n avgas. Id. at 785\u201386. Given this language, we agree with\n the Claims Court that the government\u2019s duty to indemnify\n was triggered, at the latest, when the Oil Companies were\n found liable under CERCLA due to their production of\n avgas. Id. at 794. It is undisputed that this occurred in\n the 1990s, \u201cwell before the CSA\u2019s repeal.\u201d Id.\n     On appeal, the government argues that, under the\n CSA\u2019s mandatory administrative claims process, it \u201chad no\n duty to pay the oil companies\u2019 claims until they presented\n their termination claim to GSA in 2019.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br.\n 22\u201323. According to the government, because the Oil\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40     Page: 18    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 18                                  SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US\n\n\n\n Companies had no \u201cright\u201d to sue under the CSA until they\n exhausted their administrative remedies, no \u201cduty\u201d to pay\n matured until after 2011. Id. at 23. We disagree.\n     The government seems to be drawing a distinction be-\n tween its contractual duty to indemnify the Oil Companies\n under the Avgas Contracts\u2014which is the relevant duty for\n purposes of the CSA\u2019s savings clause\u2014and its CSA duty to\n resolve a termination claim submitted under that statute.\n Appellant\u2019s Br. 24. As the Claims Court explained, how-\n ever, \u201c[t]he CSA does not dictate when the rights and du-\n ties defined in a contract mature for purposes of the\n savings clause in the repealing statute; rather, it defines a\n set of procedural rules that are unrelated to the substan-\n tive legal obligations arising under an independent con-\n tractual agreement like the one here.\u201d Shell II, 148 Fed.\n Cl. at 795.\n     Under the terms of the Avgas Contracts, \u201cthe govern-\n ment\u2019s duty to pay any new or additional charges the oil\n companies incurred by reason of the production of avgas\n was not contingent on the oil companies\u2019 act of seeking re-\n imbursement, but instead upon their incurrence of new li-\n abilities dictated by federal law.\u201d Id. at 794. The\n government\u2019s contractual duties, within the meaning of the\n savings clause, matured (at the latest) when the Oil Com-\n panies were held liable under CERCLA to pay environmen-\n tal remediation costs at the McColl site. If Congress had\n meant to limit the savings clause to claims that had been\n presented to the agency prior to the repeal, it could have\n done so. Instead, the savings clause preserves claims\n based on when the claimant\u2019s rights and the government\u2019s\n duties matured. Here, the plain language of the Avgas\n Contracts indicates that the government\u2019s duty to indem-\n nify matured in tandem with the Oil Companies\u2019 liability\n under CERCLA.\n    The government cites Tektel, Inc. v. United States, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">121\n Fed. Cl. 680<\/span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015), for the proposition that it had no duty\n\fCase: 20-2221    Document: 40      Page: 19     Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n SHELL OIL COMPANY   v. US                                   19\n\n\n\n to indemnify the Oil Companies until they exhausted the\n CSA\u2019s procedure. But in Tektel, which is not binding on\n this court, the contract specifically required the plaintiff to\n exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial\n review. <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 686<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">. As such, Tektel\u2019s right to seek judicial\n relief could not have matured until it had exhausted its ad-\n ministrative remedies, because those remedies were part\n of the contract. Here, nothing in the Avgas Contracts re-\n quires the Oil Companies to comply with the CSA\u2019s proce-\n dures\u2014let alone requires them to do so before they are\n entitled to indemnification. Notably, the CSA was not en-\n acted until years after the Oil Companies entered into the\n Avgas Contracts.\n      The government also submits that, under G.L. Chris-\n tian & Associates v. United States, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"259368\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/259368\/g-l-christian-and-associates-v-the-united-states\/\">312 F.2d 418<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ct. Cl.\n 1963), statutory and regulatory provisions must be deemed\n included within government contracts by law if they are:\n (1) required; and (2) involve a \u201cdeeply ingrained strand\u201d of\n procurement policy. Appellant\u2019s Br. 26 (quoting Gen. Eng\u2019g\n & Mach. Works v. O\u2019Keefe, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604947\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/604947\/general-engineering-machine-works-v-sean-c-okeefe-acting-secretary-of\/\">991 F.2d 775<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 779 (Fed. Cir.\n 1993)). We have recognized that \u201cChristian stands for the\n proposition that if the parties to a government contract ne-\n glect to include a clause in the contract that is otherwise\n required by regulation . . . courts will read the clause into\n the contract as a matter of law.\u201d Rockies Exp. Pipeline LLC\n v. Salazar, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">730 F.3d 1330<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing\n Christian, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"259368\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/259368\/g-l-christian-and-associates-v-the-united-states\/\">312 F.2d at 426<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201327). The government cites no\n authority establishing that exhaustion requirements were\n mandatory in government war contracts at the time of the\n Avgas Contracts. And nothing suggests that the CSA man-\n dated its procedures retroactively into the Avgas Con-\n tracts. Accordingly, we find that Christian does not apply.\n     We agree with the Claims Court that the government\u2019s\n duty to indemnify the Oil Companies and the Oil Compa-\n nies\u2019 right to reimbursement for remediation costs under\n the Avgas Contracts both matured well before the repealer\n statute\u2019s enactment. The Claims Court therefore correctly\n\fCase: 20-2221   Document: 40    Page: 20    Filed: 08\/04\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 20                                SHELL OIL COMPANY   v.

CONCLUSION\n    We have considered the government\u2019s remaining argu-\n ments and find them unpersuasive. For the foregoing rea-\n sons, we affirm the Claims Court\u2019s decision.\n                       AFFIRMED\n\f<\/pre>",

Andra filed an amended complaint, and the Defend-\n ants renewed their motion. Report and Recommendation,\n 2020 WL 2478546, at *1. Defendants argued that venue\n was improper because Stores did not commit acts of in-\n fringement in the District and the Non-Store Defendants\n did not have regular and established places of business in\n the District.\n     The magistrate judge recommended that the Non-Store\n Defendants be dismissed for improper venue but that the\n suit continue against Stores, because testimony by one\n Stores employee supported a finding of the alleged infring-\n ing acts in the District. Id. at *4\u20135. The magistrate judge\n did not consider transfer, because the parties had only\n briefed the issue of transfer where venue was improper\n against all the Defendants. Id. at *5. The magistrate judge\n discussed a potential division in the case, where venue was\n proper against some Defendants and improper against oth-\n ers, in a telephone conference on February 19, 2020, and\n Andra stated that it would proceed in the District against\n the Defendants who were not dismissed even if some of the\n Defendants were dismissed.

The district court dismissed the\n Non-Store Defendants without prejudice for improper\n venue on March 26, 2020. In a departure from its earlier\n statement that it would proceed against any Defendants\n who were not dismissed, Andra voluntarily dismissed the\n last remaining Defendant, Stores, and the district court\n subsequently dismissed all remaining claims without prej-\n udice on May 15, 2020. Andra timely filed notice of appeal\n of the dismissal of the Non-Store Defendants for improper\n venue.\n                              II\n    \u201cWe review de novo the question of proper venue under\n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(b).\u201d Westech Aerosol Corp. v. 3M Co.,\n 927 F.3d 1378, 1381\u201382 (Fed.

Thus, to establish venue in this case, Andra must\n show that each Defendant committed acts of infringement\n and maintains a regular and established place of business\n in the Eastern District of Texas.\n     To show that a defendant has a regular and established\n place of business, there are three requirements: \u201c(1) there\n must be a physical place in the district; (2) it must be a\n\fCase: 20-2009      Document: 41     Page: 5   Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ANDRA GROUP, LP   v. VICTORIA'S SECRET STORES, LLC          5\n\n\n\n regular and established place of business; and (3) it must\n be the place of the defendant.\u201d In re Cray Inc., 871 F.3d\n 1355, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2017).\n     As we stated in Cray, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has . . . in-\n structed that \u2018[t]he requirement of venue is specific and un-\n ambiguous; it is not one of those vague principles which, in\n the interests of some overriding policy, is to be given a lib-\n eral construction.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1361 (second alteration in origi-\n nal) (quoting Schnell v. Peter Eckrich & Sons, Inc., 365 U.S.\n 260, 264 (1961)); see also In re Google LLC, 949 F.3d 1338,\n 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (\u201c[T]he Supreme Court has cautioned\n against a broad reading of the venue statute.\u201d).\n     The parties do not dispute that Stores operates retail\n locations in the District, and whether venue is proper as to\n Stores is not at issue in this appeal. The question is\n whether these Stores locations can be considered \u201ca regular\n and established place of business\u201d of the Non-Store Defend-\n ants. In re Cray, 871 F.3d at 1360. Andra argues that\n Stores locations are \u201ca regular and established place of\n business\u201d of the Non-Store Defendants because Stores em-\n ployees are agents of the Non-Store Defendants, or, alter-\n natively, because the Non-Store Defendants have ratified\n Stores locations as their places of business. We address\n each argument in turn.\n                               A\n     \u201c[A] \u2018regular and established place of business\u2019 re-\n quires the regular, physical presence of an employee or\n other agent of the defendant conducting the defendant\u2019s\n business at the alleged \u2018place of business.\u2019\u201d In re Google,\n 949 F.3d at 1345. Because there is no dispute that the Non-\n Store Defendants lack employees in the District, Andra ar-\n gues that Stores employees are agents of LBI, Direct, and\n Brand.

Andra points to various public filings by LBI\n that speak in broad terms about real estate holdings and\n investments, contends that LBI controls the hiring and fir-\n ing of employees, and argues that because LBI requires\n Stores associates to sign and follow LBI\u2019s Code of Conduct,\n this indicates control over the employees. Andra argues\n that Direct \u201ccontrols store location workers by dictating\n their handling of returns of merchandise purchased on the\n [Victoria\u2019s Secret] website.\u201d Id. at 18. Finally, Andra ar-\n gues that Stores employees are agents of Brand because\n Brand \u201c\u2018closely controls the distribution and sales of its\n products\u2019 exclusively available through store locations and\n the [w]ebsite.\u201d Id. at 19 (quoting J.A. 799\u2013801 \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13,\n 15\u201316). Andra also contends that Brand\u2019s control over the\n Victoria\u2019s Secret website \u201cstrengthens the agency relation-\n ship with [] Brand.\u201d Id. at 19\u201320.\n    We considered a similar agency question in In re\n Google. There, a plaintiff sued Google for patent infringe-\n ment in the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that venue\n was proper based on the presence of several Google Global\n Cache servers in the District. In re Google, 949 F.3d at\n 1340. Google did not own the datacenters where the servers\n were hosted but contracted with two internet service\n\fCase: 20-2009      Document: 41     Page: 7   Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ANDRA GROUP, LP   v. VICTORIA'S SECRET STORES, LLC         7\n\n\n\n providers (ISPs) in the district to host the servers. Id. The\n contracts included several limitations including: restrict-\n ing \u201cthe ISPs\u2019 ability to relocate the servers without\n Google\u2019s permission,\u201d limiting unauthorized access to the\n space used by Google\u2019s servers, requiring the ISPs to pro-\n vide \u201cinstallation services,\u201d forbidding the ISPs from ac-\n cessing, using, or disposing of the servers without Google\u2019s\n permission, and requiring the ISPs to provide \u201cremote as-\n sistance services\u201d involving basic maintenance activities\n performed on the servers by the ISP\u2019s on-site technician, if\n requested by Google. Id. at 1340\u201341.\n     The relevant inquiry was \u201cwhether the ISPs [were] act-\n ing as Google\u2019s agent.\u201d Id. at 1345. We held that although\n the installation of the servers and provision of mainte-\n nance may suggest an agency relationship, the installation\n activity was a \u201cone-time event for each server\u201d that did not\n constitute the conduct of a \u201cregular and established\u201d busi-\n ness, and \u201cSIT ha[d] not established that the ISPs perform-\n ing the specified maintenance functions [were] conducting\n Google\u2019s business within the meaning of the statute.\u201d Id.\n at 1346.\n      Here, as in Google, none of Andra\u2019s arguments are suf-\n ficient to show that Stores employees are agents of the\n Non-Store Defendants. None of the public filings cited by\n Andra demonstrate LBI\u2019s control, because they are docu-\n ments covering all of LBI\u2019s brands. The documents\u2019 use of\n \u201cwe\u201d does not convey that \u201cwe\u201d means LBI specifically, but\n that \u201cwe\u201d could include the individual subsidiary brands,\n like Stores. See J.A. 452, 846. Andra\u2019s contention that LBI\n controls the hiring and firing of store employees is directly\n contradicted by the testimony of the store manager for the\n Plano, Texas store, Lisa Barcelona, who stated during her\n deposition that she, a Stores employee, interviews associ-\n ates and makes offers of employment. J.A. 642\u201343. She also\n testified that she decides whether to fire employees and\n that she does not need any approval before doing so, and\n that it is she who holds Stores employees at her store\n\fCase: 20-2009    Document: 41      Page: 8    Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 8          ANDRA GROUP, LP   v. VICTORIA'S SECRET STORES, LLC\n\n\n\n accountable for following the Code of Conduct, not LBI.\n Thus, none of the facts alleged by Andra are sufficient to\n prove that Stores employees are agents of LBI, because LBI\n does not have \u201cthe right to direct or control\u201d Stores employ-\n ees, an essential element of an agency relationship. In re\n Google, 949 F.3d at 1345.\n      Additionally, while Stores locations accepting returns\n of Direct merchandise purchased on the website is a service\n that may benefit Direct, Andra has not shown that Direct\n controls this process. This one discrete task is analogous to\n the ISPs\u2019 installation and maintenance of the servers in\n Google, which we found insufficient to establish an agency\n relationship. Id. at 1346. Finally, Brand\u2019s close control of\n its products and the website does not equate to \u201cthe right\n to direct or control\u201d employees at the physical Stores loca-\n tions in the District. Id. at 1345.\n     For the above reasons, we agree with the district court\n that Andra has not established that any of the Non-Store\n Defendants exercise the degree of control over Stores em-\n ployees required to find an agency relationship.\n                              B\n     Andra\u2019s second venue theory is that the Non-Store De-\n fendants ratified Stores locations as their own places of\n business such that Non-Store Defendants may be said to\n maintain a regular and established place of business in the\n District.\n     A threshold inquiry when determining whether the\n place of business of one company can be imputed to an-\n other, related company is whether they have maintained\n corporate separateness. If corporate separateness has not\n been maintained, the place of business of one corporation\n may be imputed to the other for venue purposes. But where\n related companies have maintained corporate separate-\n ness, the place of business of one corporation is not imputed\n to the other for venue purposes. See Cannon Mfg. Co. v.\n\fCase: 20-2009      Document: 41     Page: 9     Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n ANDRA GROUP, LP   v. VICTORIA'S SECRET STORES, LLC            9\n\n\n\n Cudahy Packing Co., 267 U.S. 333, 334\u201335 (1925); 14D\n Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice\n and Procedure \u00a7 3823 & nn.25\u201326 (4th ed.).\n     Andra does not argue that the Defendants have not\n maintained corporate separateness. Andra contends that\n each of the Non-Store Defendants has ratified the retail\n stores as its own based on the criteria outlined in In re\n Cray, including \u201cwhether the defendant owns or leases the\n place, or exercises other attributes of possession or control\n over the place,\u201d \u201cthe storing of materials at a place in the\n district so that they can be distributed or sold from that\n place,\u201d and the \u201cdefendant\u2019s representations that it has a\n place of business in the district.\u201d 871 F.3d at 1363.\n     Andra argues (1) that LBI has ratified store locations\n through its control over store operations and by holding out\n store locations as its own; (2) that Direct has ratified store\n locations by allowing merchandise purchased online to be\n returned in stores and by directing customers to store loca-\n tions using the \u201cFind a Store\u201d feature; and (3) that Brand\n has ratified store locations by distributing and selling its\n merchandise from Store locations and because it is listed\n as the registrant for the Victoria\u2019s Secret website.\n     But \u201cthe mere fact that a defendant has advertised that\n it has a place of business or has even set up an office is not\n sufficient; the defendant must actually engage in business\n from that location.\u201d In re Cray, 871 F.3d at 1364 (emphasis\n added). Andra has not shown that the Non-Store Defend-\n ants actually engage in business at Stores locations. Andra\n asserts that the Non-Store Defendants maintain a \u201cunified\n business model\u201d with Stores, asserting many of the same\n facts it set forth in support of its agency theory, but the fact\n that the entities work together in some aspects, as dis-\n cussed above, is insufficient to show ratification. See In re\n ZTE(USA) Inc., 890 F.3d 1008, 1015 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (hold-\n ing that a contractual relationship between two entities\n \u201cdoes not necessarily make [the first company\u2019s] call center\n\fCase: 20-2009    Document: 41       Page: 10   Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 10         ANDRA GROUP, LP   v. VICTORIA'S SECRET STORES, LLC\n\n\n\n \u2018a regular and established place of business\u2019 of [the second\n company] in the [district]\u201d).\n     Several additional factors weigh against a finding of\n ratification here. The Non-Store defendants do not own or\n lease Stores locations; Stores leases and performs all oper-\n ations at the retail locations. Decision, 2020 WL 1465894\n at *5. The Victoria\u2019s Secret website\u2019s \u201cFind a Store\u201d feature\n points consumers to Stores locations, not Non-Store De-\n fendants locations. J.A. 829. The Non-Store Defendants do\n not display their corporate names in the retail locations.\n Decision, 2020 WL 1465894 at *5. Non-Store Defendants\n carry out different business functions than Stores. Id. And\n the companies\u2019 shared use of \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret\u201d in their\n name does not detract from the separateness of their busi-\n nesses. Giving \u201creasoned consideration to all relevant fac-\n tors or attributes of the relationship\u201d between Stores and\n Non-Store Defendants, Andra has not met its burden to\n show that Non-Store Defendants have ratified Stores loca-\n tions as their own places of business such that Non-Store\n Defendants may be said to maintain a regular and estab-\n lished place of business in the District.\n                              III\n      All three Cray factors must be met for venue to be\n proper against a defendant. The second Cray factor, a \u201c\u2018reg-\n ular and established place of business\u2019 requires the regu-\n lar, physical presence of an employee or other agent of the\n defendant conducting the defendant\u2019s business at the al-\n leged \u2018place of business.\u2019\u201d In re Google, 949 F.3d at 1345.\n Because Andra has not demonstrated that LBI, Brand, or\n Direct has \u201cthe right to direct or control\u201d the actions of\n Store employees, id. at 1346, it has not shown the \u201cregular,\n physical presence of an employee or other agent\u201d of LBI,\n Brand, or Direct in the District. The Defendants have also\n maintained corporate formalities and Andra has not shown\n that Non-Store Defendants ratified Stores locations in the\n District as their own places of business.

Id. at 1340\u201341.\n     The relevant inquiry was \u201cwhether the ISPs [were] act-\n ing as Google\u2019s agent.\u201d Id. at 1345. We held that although\n the installation of the servers and provision of mainte-\n nance may suggest an agency relationship, the installation\n activity was a \u201cone-time event for each server\u201d that did not\n constitute the conduct of a \u201cregular and established\u201d busi-\n ness, and \u201cSIT ha[d] not established that the ISPs perform-\n ing the specified maintenance functions [were] conducting\n Google\u2019s business within the meaning of the statute.\u201d Id.\n at 1346.\n      Here, as in Google, none of Andra\u2019s arguments are suf-\n ficient to show that Stores employees are agents of the\n Non-Store Defendants. None of the public filings cited by\n Andra demonstrate LBI\u2019s control, because they are docu-\n ments covering all of LBI\u2019s brands. The documents\u2019 use of\n \u201cwe\u201d does not convey that \u201cwe\u201d means LBI specifically, but\n that \u201cwe\u201d could include the individual subsidiary brands,\n like Stores. See J.A. 452, 846. Andra\u2019s contention that LBI\n controls the hiring and firing of store employees is directly\n contradicted by the testimony of the store manager for the\n Plano, Texas store, Lisa Barcelona, who stated during her\n deposition that she, a Stores employee, interviews associ-\n ates and makes offers of employment. J.A. 642\u201343.

VICTORIA'S SECRET STORES, LLC\n\n\n\n accountable for following the Code of Conduct, not LBI.\n Thus, none of the facts alleged by Andra are sufficient to\n prove that Stores employees are agents of LBI, because LBI\n does not have \u201cthe right to direct or control\u201d Stores employ-\n ees, an essential element of an agency relationship. In re\n Google, 949 F.3d at 1345.\n      Additionally, while Stores locations accepting returns\n of Direct merchandise purchased on the website is a service\n that may benefit Direct, Andra has not shown that Direct\n controls this process. This one discrete task is analogous to\n the ISPs\u2019 installation and maintenance of the servers in\n Google, which we found insufficient to establish an agency\n relationship. Id. at 1346. Finally, Brand\u2019s close control of\n its products and the website does not equate to \u201cthe right\n to direct or control\u201d employees at the physical Stores loca-\n tions in the District. Id. at 1345.\n     For the above reasons, we agree with the district court\n that Andra has not established that any of the Non-Store\n Defendants exercise the degree of control over Stores em-\n ployees required to find an agency relationship.\n                              B\n     Andra\u2019s second venue theory is that the Non-Store De-\n fendants ratified Stores locations as their own places of\n business such that Non-Store Defendants may be said to\n maintain a regular and established place of business in the\n District.\n     A threshold inquiry when determining whether the\n place of business of one company can be imputed to an-\n other, related company is whether they have maintained\n corporate separateness. If corporate separateness has not\n been maintained, the place of business of one corporation\n may be imputed to the other for venue purposes. But where\n related companies have maintained corporate separate-\n ness, the place of business of one corporation is not imputed\n to the other for venue purposes. See Cannon Mfg.

Andra contends that\n each of the Non-Store Defendants has ratified the retail\n stores as its own based on the criteria outlined in In re\n Cray, including \u201cwhether the defendant owns or leases the\n place, or exercises other attributes of possession or control\n over the place,\u201d \u201cthe storing of materials at a place in the\n district so that they can be distributed or sold from that\n place,\u201d and the \u201cdefendant\u2019s representations that it has a\n place of business in the district.\u201d 871 F.3d at 1363.\n     Andra argues (1) that LBI has ratified store locations\n through its control over store operations and by holding out\n store locations as its own; (2) that Direct has ratified store\n locations by allowing merchandise purchased online to be\n returned in stores and by directing customers to store loca-\n tions using the \u201cFind a Store\u201d feature; and (3) that Brand\n has ratified store locations by distributing and selling its\n merchandise from Store locations and because it is listed\n as the registrant for the Victoria\u2019s Secret website.\n     But \u201cthe mere fact that a defendant has advertised that\n it has a place of business or has even set up an office is not\n sufficient; the defendant must actually engage in business\n from that location.\u201d In re Cray, 871 F.3d at 1364 (emphasis\n added). Andra has not shown that the Non-Store Defend-\n ants actually engage in business at Stores locations. Andra\n asserts that the Non-Store Defendants maintain a \u201cunified\n business model\u201d with Stores, asserting many of the same\n facts it set forth in support of its agency theory, but the fact\n that the entities work together in some aspects, as dis-\n cussed above, is insufficient to show ratification.

Dep\u2019t of\n Def., No. DC-1221-19-0766-W-1, 2020 WL 1238058\n (M.S.P.B. Mar. 11, 2020). She appeals. We affirm because\n we agree with the Board that none of the actions that\n Ms. Blount alleged are \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d under 5 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A).\n                             ***\n      Ms. Blount was an assistant principal at the federally\n operated Gordon Elementary School in Fort Bragg, North\n Carolina. In August 2019, she filed an individual-right-of-\n action (\u201cIRA\u201d) appeal with the Board alleging that the De-\n partment of Defense Education Activity (that is, the agency\n that runs Gordon Elementary) engaged in a personnel ac-\n tion in retaliation for Ms. Blount\u2019s whistleblower activity.\n See S.A. 16. 1 In that proceeding (and in the Office of Spe-\n cial Counsel complaint leading to it), she alleged that the\n agency retaliated with \u201cdisparate work assignment[s].\u201d\n S.A. 16 (IRA appeal form). Specifically, Ms. Blount pointed\n to (1) an order for her to attend a single training session in\n April 2019 to make up for one she allegedly missed (though\n she disputes missing it), (2) a requirement by those con-\n ducting the training for attendees to submit an \u201caction\n plan\u201d (a curricular requirement for all attendees), and\n (3) reminder emails from the same people that she needed\n to complete that action plan (and offering to help). See\n S.A. 4\u20135, 17\u201318. As the Board observed, \u201c[i]t is undisputed\n that [Ms. Blount] received no discipline of any kind\u201d for\n \u201cfailing to respond to emails . . . regarding her action plan,\n or for failing to provide the plan itself.\u201d S.A. 6.\n\n\n\n\n     1  \u201cS.A.\u201d refers to the supplemental appendix filed\n with the respondent\u2019s response brief.\n\fCase: 21-1393       Document: 35   Page: 3    Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BLOUNT   v. MSPB                                            3\n\n\n\n     The Board\u2019s jurisdiction is strictly limited by law. See\n Bolton v. MSPB, 154 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1998). To\n establish the Board\u2019s jurisdiction in an IRA appeal, an ap-\n pellant must raise nonfrivolous (i.e., legally adequate) alle-\n gations not only (1) that she engaged in whistleblowing\n activity but also (2) that the whistleblowing was a contrib-\n uting factor in the agency\u2019s decision to take or fail to take\n a \u201cpersonnel action,\u201d as defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A).\n Stoyanov v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, 474 F.3d 1377, 1379\n (Fed. Cir. 2007). This case concerns the second require-\n ment: whether the allegedly retaliatory actions were \u201cper-\n sonnel actions\u201d as \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A) defines them.\n     The Board first concluded that Ms. Blount had not ad-\n equately alleged that these actions were \u201cdisparate\u201d as to\n her. S.A. 6\u20137. The Board also determined that she had\n \u201cnot identified any conduct by the agency\u201d that \u201cqualifies\n as a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2).\u201d S.A. 7.\n Accordingly, it dismissed the appeal. See Willis v. Dep\u2019t of\n Agriculture, 141 F.3d 1139, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1998).\n     We agree with the Board. A party seeking to bring an\n IRA appeal has the burden to establish jurisdiction.\n Ms. Blount has not identified which category of activity in\n \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A) that the alleged actions would fall under.\n Respondent suggests that the closest possible categories\n are (1) \u201ca decision . . . concerning education or training if\n the education may reasonably be expected to lead to an ap-\n pointment, promotion, performance evaluation, or other\n [personnel] action\u201d and (2) a \u201csignificant change of duties,\n responsibilities, or working conditions.\u201d See 5 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A). Neither category conceivably fits the alle-\n gations here\u2014nor do any of the others.\n     We note that in addition to the allegations discussed\n above, Ms. Blount has pointed to her reassignment from\n one full-time to two part-time assistant principal positions,\n arguing that this too was a retaliatory action. See\n S.A. 17\u201318. That action, however, is beyond the scope of\n\fCase: 21-1393     Document: 35       Page: 4    Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 4                                              BLOUNT   v. MSPB\n\n\n\n this underlying IRA at the Board (and therefore beyond\n this appeal in our court). Rather, it is at issue in a different\n IRA appeal of Ms. Blount\u2019s. See S.A. 4 n.2 (citing Blount v.\n Dep\u2019t of Def., No. DC-1221-19-0765-W-1 (M.S.P.B. Aug. 2,\n 2018)). The Board properly declined to address the reas-\n signment in this case under the doctrine of adjudicatory ef-\n ficiency. See Boyd v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, 561 F. App\u2019x 978, 982\n (Fed. Cir. 2014).\n                              ***\n     In summary, even if we assume that everything\n Ms. Blount says is true, none of the actions that the agency\n took constituted a retaliatory \u201cpersonnel action\u201d under the\n meaning of the whistleblower statute. Accordingly, the\n Board correctly concluded that it did not have jurisdiction\n to hear an IRA appeal that was based on these allegations.\n We therefore affirm.\n                         AFFIRMED\n                             COSTS\n No costs.\n\f",

MSPB\n\n\n\n     The Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) dis-\n missed petitioner Gladys S. Blount\u2019s whistleblower retali-\n ation appeal for lack of jurisdiction. See Blount v. Dep\u2019t of\n Def., No. DC-1221-19-0766-W-1, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2020 WL 1238058<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">\n (M.S.P.B. Mar. 11, 2020). She appeals. We affirm because\n we agree with the Board that none of the actions that\n Ms. Blount alleged are \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d under 5 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A).\n                             ***\n      Ms. Blount was an assistant principal at the federally\n operated Gordon Elementary School in Fort Bragg, North\n Carolina. In August 2019, she filed an individual-right-of-\n action (\u201cIRA\u201d) appeal with the Board alleging that the De-\n partment of Defense Education Activity (that is, the agency\n that runs Gordon Elementary) engaged in a personnel ac-\n tion in retaliation for Ms. Blount\u2019s whistleblower activity.\n See S.A. 16. 1 In that proceeding (and in the Office of Spe-\n cial Counsel complaint leading to it), she alleged that the\n agency retaliated with \u201cdisparate work assignment[s].\u201d\n S.A. 16 (IRA appeal form). Specifically, Ms. Blount pointed\n to (1) an order for her to attend a single training session in\n April 2019 to make up for one she allegedly missed (though\n she disputes missing it), (2) a requirement by those con-\n ducting the training for attendees to submit an \u201caction\n plan\u201d (a curricular requirement for all attendees), and\n (3) reminder emails from the same people that she needed\n to complete that action plan (and offering to help). See\n S.A. 4\u20135, 17\u201318. As the Board observed, \u201c[i]t is undisputed\n that [Ms. Blount] received no discipline of any kind\u201d for\n \u201cfailing to respond to emails . . . regarding her action plan,\n or for failing to provide the plan itself.\u201d S.A. 6.\n\n\n\n\n     1  \u201cS.A.\u201d refers to the supplemental appendix filed\n with the respondent\u2019s response brief.\n\fCase: 21-1393       Document: 35   Page: 3    Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n BLOUNT   v. MSPB                                            3\n\n\n\n     The Board\u2019s jurisdiction is strictly limited by law. See\n Bolton v. MSPB, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757718\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/757718\/david-d-bolton-v-merit-systems-protection-board\/\">154 F.3d 1313<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1998). To\n establish the Board\u2019s jurisdiction in an IRA appeal, an ap-\n pellant must raise nonfrivolous (i.e., legally adequate) alle-\n gations not only (1) that she engaged in whistleblowing\n activity but also (2) that the whistleblowing was a contrib-\n uting factor in the agency\u2019s decision to take or fail to take\n a \u201cpersonnel action,\u201d as defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A).\n Stoyanov v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"210842\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/210842\/stoyanov-v-department-of-the-navy\/\">474 F.3d 1377<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1379\n (Fed. Cir. 2007). This case concerns the second require-\n ment: whether the allegedly retaliatory actions were \u201cper-\n sonnel actions\u201d as \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A) defines them.\n     The Board first concluded that Ms. Blount had not ad-\n equately alleged that these actions were \u201cdisparate\u201d as to\n her. S.A. 6\u20137. The Board also determined that she had\n \u201cnot identified any conduct by the agency\u201d that \u201cqualifies\n as a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2).\u201d S.A. 7.\n Accordingly, it dismissed the appeal. See Willis v. Dep\u2019t of\n Agriculture, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753082\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/753082\/william-e-willis-ii-v-department-of-agriculture\/\">141 F.3d 1139<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1998).\n     We agree with the Board. A party seeking to bring an\n IRA appeal has the burden to establish jurisdiction.\n Ms. Blount has not identified which category of activity in\n \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A) that the alleged actions would fall under.\n Respondent suggests that the closest possible categories\n are (1) \u201ca decision . . . concerning education or training if\n the education may reasonably be expected to lead to an ap-\n pointment, promotion, performance evaluation, or other\n [personnel] action\u201d and (2) a \u201csignificant change of duties,\n responsibilities, or working conditions.\u201d See 5 U.S.C.\n \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A). Neither category conceivably fits the alle-\n gations here\u2014nor do any of the others.\n     We note that in addition to the allegations discussed\n above, Ms. Blount has pointed to her reassignment from\n one full-time to two part-time assistant principal positions,\n arguing that this too was a retaliatory action. See\n S.A. 17\u201318. That action, however, is beyond the scope of\n\fCase: 21-1393     Document: 35       Page: 4    Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 4                                              BLOUNT   v. MSPB\n\n\n\n this underlying IRA at the Board (and therefore beyond\n this appeal in our court). Rather, it is at issue in a different\n IRA appeal of Ms. Blount\u2019s. See S.A. 4 n.2 (citing Blount v.\n Dep\u2019t of Def., No. DC-1221-19-0765-W-1 (M.S.P.B. Aug. 2,\n 2018)). The Board properly declined to address the reas-\n signment in this case under the doctrine of adjudicatory ef-\n ficiency. See Boyd v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, 561 F. App\u2019x 978, 982\n (Fed. Cir. 2014).\n                              ***\n     In summary, even if we assume that everything\n Ms. Blount says is true, none of the actions that the agency\n took constituted a retaliatory \u201cpersonnel action\u201d under the\n meaning of the whistleblower statute. Accordingly, the\n Board correctly concluded that it did not have jurisdiction\n to hear an IRA appeal that was based on these allegations.\n We therefore affirm.\n                         AFFIRMED\n                             COSTS\n No costs.\n\f<\/pre>",

LG seeks to challenge the\n district court\u2019s decision denying LG\u2019s post-trial motions re-\n garding infringement, invalidity, and willfulness (all of\n which were decided in the September Order). LG also chal-\n lenges the district court\u2019s pretrial decision to allow the join-\n der of Hitachi and argues that, without such joinder,\n Limited lacks statutory authority to bring suit.\n     After LG filed its notice of appeal, Mondis moved to dis-\n miss the appeal as untimely, arguing that LG needed to file\n notice of appeal within thirty days of the September Order.\n We ordered the parties to address jurisdiction in the merits\n briefing.\n                                II\n     We have jurisdiction to hear certain interlocutory ap-\n peals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(c)(2), which provides the Fed-\n eral Circuit with exclusive jurisdiction over \u201can appeal\n from a judgment in a civil action for patent infringement\n which would otherwise be appealable to the United States\n Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and is final except\n\fCase: 20-1812     Document: 68     Page: 4    Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 4            MONDIS TECHNOLOGY LTD.    v. LG ELECTRONICS INC.\n\n\n\n for an accounting.\u201d Appeals under \u00a7 1292(c)(2) are subject\n to the time limits prescribed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a):\n     Except as otherwise provided in this section, no ap-\n     peal shall bring any judgment, order or decree in\n     an action, suit or proceeding of a civil nature before\n     a court of appeals for review unless notice of appeal\n     is filed, within thirty days after the entry of such\n     judgment, order or decree.\n Thus, LG had thirty days from the date at which the dis-\n trict court\u2019s judgment became \u201cfinal except for an account-\n ing\u201d to file an interlocutory appeal.\n      We have previously held that under \u00a7 1292(c)(2), a\n judgment is final except for an accounting when all liability\n issues have been resolved, and only a determination of\n damages remains. See Robert Bosch, LLC v. Pylon Mfg.\n Corp., 719 F.3d 1305, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (en banc) (\u201cAn\n \u2018accounting\u2019 in the context of \u00a7 1292(c)(2) includes the de-\n termination of damages . . . .\u201d). LG does not challenge this\n holding, nor could it, since LG seeks interlocutory review\n of the district court\u2019s liability determination while damages\n remain outstanding.\n      In this case, all liability issues were resolved with the\n district court\u2019s September Order which ruled on LG\u2019s post-\n trial motions regarding infringement and invalidity and\n left only damages-related motions outstanding. Therefore,\n for the purposes of appeal under \u00a7 1292(c)(2), this case was\n final except for an accounting after the September Order,\n and LG had thirty days from the September Order to file\n notice of interlocutory appeal. Since LG did not file its no-\n tice of appeal until May 8, 2020, more than seven months\n after the September Order, LG\u2019s appeal is untimely, and\n we lack jurisdiction to consider the matter.\n      Our ruling is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s de-\n cision in Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co., 486 U.S. 196\n (1988). Following a jury verdict in a diversity case removed\n\fCase: 20-1812      Document: 68       Page: 5    Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n MONDIS TECHNOLOGY LTD.     v. LG ELECTRONICS INC.              5\n\n\n\n to federal district court, the petitioner in Budinich timely\n filed motions for a new trial and for attorney\u2019s fees. Id.\n at 197. In a first order, the district court denied the new-\n trial motions but did not resolve attorney\u2019s fees. Id. at\n 197\u201398. Months later, the district court issued a final order\n resolving attorney\u2019s fees. Id. at 198. Within thirty days of\n the final order, the petitioner filed notice of appeal covering\n all the district court\u2019s post-trial orders. Id. The petitioner\n argued that such an appeal was timely with respect to the\n merits, relying on a provision of Colorado state law which\n instructed that a claim was not final and appealable until\n attorney\u2019s fees had been determined. Id. The Supreme\n Court disagreed, finding that federal law governed under\n the Supremacy Clause, and that under federal law, the\n merits decision was final after the first post-trial order that\n resolved all issues except for attorney\u2019s fees. Id. at 200\n (\u201c[W]e think it indisputable that a claim for attorney\u2019s fees\n is not part of the merits of the action to which the fees per-\n tain . . . .\u201d). Similarly, here the district court\u2019s decision was\n final as to liability at the time of the September Order that\n resolved all liability issues. Just as the outstanding matter\n of attorney\u2019s fees could not toll the time for appeal in Budi-\n nich, the outstanding damages determination cannot toll\n the time for LG to appeal here.\n                                III\n      LG\u2019s timeliness arguments focus on the Federal Rules,\n rather than the statutory requirements for jurisdiction. As\n an initial matter, the Rules cannot override federal statute\n any more than state law could do so in Budinich, and to the\n extent that there is any conflict between the Rules and fed-\n eral statutes, the statutes must prevail. See Bowles v. Rus-\n sell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007) (\u201c[The Supreme Court] has\n no authority to create equitable exceptions to jurisdictional\n requirements . . . .\u201d). But we do not read any conflict be-\n tween the Rules and the statutory requirements of appeal\n and conclude that, read together, the statutes and the\n Rules bar this interlocutory appeal.\n\fCase: 20-1812     Document: 68      Page: 6    Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 6            MONDIS TECHNOLOGY LTD.    v. LG ELECTRONICS INC.\n\n\n\n     The parties first disagree over what interlocutory judg-\n ment is being challenged in this appeal. Mondis argues\n that LG is appealing from the September Order because\n that order resolved all liability issues such that the judg-\n ment became final except for an accounting. LG argues\n that the underlying judgment being challenged is the jury\u2019s\n special verdict, which was constructively entered as a judg-\n ment by operation of Rule 58(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil\n Procedure (FRCP) on September 9, 2019, prior even to the\n September Order. 1\n     We agree with Mondis that the September Order is the\n operative date that started the thirty-day clock to file a no-\n tice of appeal, because that is the date that all liability is-\n sues became final, such that the judgment on liability\n became ripe for an appeal. No matter what judgment is be-\n ing challenged, the date that matters under \u00a7 1292(c)(2) is\n the date at which the case became final except for an ac-\n counting.\n     The parties next dispute the effect of Rule 4 of the Fed-\n eral Rules of Appellate Procedure (FRAP).

LG argues\n that the underlying judgment being challenged is the jury\u2019s\n special verdict, which was constructively entered as a judg-\n ment by operation of Rule 58(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil\n Procedure (FRCP) on September 9, 2019, prior even to the\n September Order. 1\n     We agree with Mondis that the September Order is the\n operative date that started the thirty-day clock to file a no-\n tice of appeal, because that is the date that all liability is-\n sues became final, such that the judgment on liability\n became ripe for an appeal. No matter what judgment is be-\n ing challenged, the date that matters under \u00a7 1292(c)(2) is\n the date at which the case became final except for an ac-\n counting.\n     The parties next dispute the effect of Rule 4 of the Fed-\n eral Rules of Appellate Procedure (FRAP). FRAP 4(a)(4) in-\n structs that, if a party timely files any of several\n enumerated motions, including post-trial motions for judg-\n ment under FRCP 50(b) or for a new trial under FRCP 59,\n \u201cthe time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the en-\n try of the order disposing of the last such remaining mo-\n tion.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n     1    However, when asked at oral argument, LG\u2019s attor-\n ney appeared to agree that the September Order was being\n challenged.

MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n\n     Before NEWMAN, PROST, and STOLL, Circuit Judges.\n PER CURIAM.\n     Gilberto Torrez appeals the decision of the United\n States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, which af-\n firmed a decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals that\n denied service connection for Mr. Torrez\u2019s elbow, knee, and\n back injuries and reduced the rating for his right ankle dis-\n ability. Because Mr. Torrez raises only factual challenges,\n we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n                        BACKGROUND\n                               I\n      Mr. Torrez served in the United States Army from 1970\n to 1991. He reported lower back pain in 1973, 1975, and\n 1983, but medical examinations concluded that his spine\n was normal. S.A. 1. In May 1985, Mr. Torrez reported\n right knee discomfort, but a subsequently conducted range\n of motion test and an X-ray report showed that his knee\n was normal. Id. at 1\u20132. After another examination in\n June 1985, he was diagnosed with chondromalacia (run-\n ner\u2019s knee). In 1986, Mr. Torrez reported left elbow pain\n while lifting and flexing, but an X-ray revealed a normal\n left elbow. Mr. Torrez also reported back pain after doing\n \u201ca large number of pushups,\u201d and the physician concluded\n that his pain was due to \u201cacute sacroiliitis\u201d (inflammation).\n Id. at 2. During an examination in October 1991, Mr. Tor-\n rez reported that he had \u201carthritis, rheumatism, or bursi-\n tis;\u201d recurrent back pain since April 1990; that he twisted\n his right knee during a morning jog; and that he had tennis\n elbow in his right arm. Id. The examining physician did\n not find any abnormalities in Mr. Torrez\u2019s back, knees, or\n elbows.\n     Following his discharge from the Army in 1991,\n Mr. Torrez filed a claim for service connection for bilateral\n elbow, bilateral knee, ankle, and lower back disabilities.\n\fCase: 21-1081     Document: 36      Page: 3    Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n TORREZ   v. MCDONOUGH                                        3\n\n\n\n The Department of Veterans Affairs examined him in 1992\n and assigned a 10-percent rating for his right ankle but de-\n nied service connection for his elbow, knee, and lower back\n disabilities after the examination reports showed no abnor-\n malities. Mr. Torrez sought to reopen his knee claim in\n 2004, which the VA denied.\n     In 2016, Mr. Torrez filed a claim for an increased rat-\n ing for his right ankle and sought to reopen his service con-\n nection claims for his elbow, knee, and back conditions. He\n received examinations for his ankle in March 2016 and No-\n vember 2018. The 2018 examiner noted that Mr. Torrez\u2019s\n right ankle showed improved rotation since his 2016 exam-\n ination, with dorsiflexion from 0 to 15 degrees and plantar\n flexion from 0 to 35 degrees.\n     During the November 2018 examination, the examiner\n also found that his in-service complaints for his elbow,\n knee, and back conditions did not represent chronic condi-\n tions during service and that these current disabilities\n were not related to service. Regarding his right knee, the\n examiner diagnosed Mr. Torrez as suffering from patellar\n tendonitis, degenerative arthritis, medial collateral liga-\n ment sprain, and chondrocalcinosis. The examiner deter-\n mined, however, that these problems were \u201cless likely . . .\n incurred in or caused by the knee pain and discomfort dur-\n ing service\u201d and that his \u201ccurrent knee conditions . . . rep-\n resent a different pathological timeline\u201d than his in-service\n condition. S.A. 82; see also id. at 3, 18. The examiner also\n diagnosed Mr. Torrez with tennis elbow but concluded that\n the condition was resolved during service. Id. at 82.\n     Next, the examiner determined that Mr. Torrez\u2019s back\n disability was \u201cless than likely . . . incurred in or caused by\n the complaints of back pain during service\u201d and that there\n was a \u201csignificant absence of continuity of care to support\n that the condition was chronic and continuous beyond its\n duration in the military.\u201d Id. Therefore, the examiner con-\n cluded that Mr. Torrez\u2019s elbow, knee, and back injuries\n\fCase: 21-1081     Document: 36      Page: 4   Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 4                                      TORREZ   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n were not service related. Mr. Torrez filed a notice of disa-\n greement with the findings of the 2018 examination. The\n VA subsequently confirmed its service connection denials\n and ankle rating.\n                               II\n     Mr. Torrez then appealed to the Board. In denying ser-\n vice connection for his elbow, knee, and back disabilities,\n the Board explained that these issues had all resolved dur-\n ing service and did not indicate chronic conditions. It ex-\n plained that \u201c[t]he four current conditions [that\n Mr. Torrez] has today appear to have developed sometime\n between his separation from service, and 2004.\u201d S.A. 19.\n As for his request for an increased rating for his right ankle\n disability, the Board found that Mr. Torrez was entitled to\n a 20-percent rating prior to November 2018, and a 10-per-\n cent rating after November 2018 because his November\n 2018 examination showed only moderate limitation in con-\n trast to his March 2016 examination, which showed\n marked limitation of motion.\n      Mr. Torrez appealed to the Veterans Court, which af-\n firmed the Board\u2019s decision. Torrez v. Wilkie, No. 19-5859,\n 2020 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1474 (Vet. App. July 31,\n 2020). The Veterans Court explained that \u201cestablishing\n service connection requires competent evidence (medical or\n lay, depending on the circumstances) of a current disabil-\n ity, an in-service incurrence of a disease or injury, and a\n link between the claimed disability and the in-service dis-\n ease or injury.\u201d Id. at *8 (citing Marcelino v. Shulkin,\n 29 Vet. App. 155, 157 (2018)). Because Mr. Torrez was di-\n agnosed with various forms of arthritis, which the VA con-\n siders to be a chronic condition under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.309(a),\n the court explained that \u201cservice connection may be estab-\n lished on a presumptive basis through a showing of chro-\n nicity or continuity of symptomatology.\u201d Id. at *8\u20139 (citing\n Walker v. Shinskei, 708 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2013)).\n In other words, Mr. Torrez could prove he was entitled to\n\fCase: 21-1081     Document: 36     Page: 5    Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n TORREZ   v. MCDONOUGH                                       5\n\n\n\n service connection by providing competent evidence that he\n suffered from a chronic condition or that his symptoms\n were continuous.\n     The Veterans Court determined that Mr. Torrez did\n not identify any error in the Board\u2019s finding of a lack of a\n chronic condition because the evidence that he cited (diag-\n noses of various forms of arthritis) did not indicate that the\n conditions were diagnosed during service. Id. at *9 (cita-\n tion omitted). As to whether his symptoms were continu-\n ous, the court concluded that the Board did not err in\n finding that Mr. Torrez\u2019s in-service complaints resolved\n during his service and did not indicate chronic conditions.\n Id. at *12.\n     The court also noted that the Board did not address\n Mr. Torrez\u2019s 1992 VA medical examination\u2014which did not\n show any disability of the knees, elbows, or back\u2014and that\n Mr. Torrez\u2019s medical records from the Wilford Hall Medical\n Center after 1992 were not relevant because they generally\n pertained to his ongoing heart condition. Id. at *10\u201311.\n The court determined that the Board\u2019s conclusions were\n supported by the in-service treatment records and the No-\n vember 2018 examination because these additional records\n \u201cconfirm that he didn\u2019t have chronic disabilities within the\n presumptive period or don\u2019t reference his conditions at all.\u201d\n Id. at *11.\n     The court then turned to Mr. Torrez\u2019s claim for in-\n creased rating for his ankle disability. Although the Vet-\n erans Court \u201cobserve[d] that the Board described the\n ranges of marked limitation and moderate limitation with-\n out specifying the origin of where those standards came\n from,\u201d it noted that the error was not prejudicial and would\n not have changed the outcome of the decision. Id.\n at *14\u201315. Finally, the Veterans Court determined that\n Mr. Torrez \u201chas not identified any error in the Board\u2019s re-\n liance on the November 2018 exam to determine that he is\n entitled to 20% before November 2018 and 10% thereafter.\u201d\n\fCase: 21-1081     Document: 36     Page: 6    Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 6                                      TORREZ   v. MCDONOUGH\n\n\n\n Id. at *15. Mr. Torrez then appealed this decision to our\n court.\n                         DISCUSSION\n      Our jurisdiction in cases from the Veterans Court is\n limited.    Wanless v. Shinseki, 618 F.3d 1333, 1336\n (Fed. Cir. 2010). We may review a decision of the Veterans\n Court with respect to a rule of law or interpretation of a\n statute or regulation relied on by the Veterans Court in its\n decision. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a). Absent a constitutional is-\n sue, we lack the jurisdiction to \u201creview (A) a challenge to a\n factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regu-\n lation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d Id.\n \u00a7 7292(d)(2). \u201cAlthough the veterans benefits adjudication\n system is nonadversarial and paternalistic,\u201d \u201cthe ultimate\n burden of showing jurisdiction rests with the veteran.\u201d\n Butler v. Principi, 244 F.3d 1337, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2001)\n (first citing Collaro v. West, 136 F.3d 1304, 1309\u201310\n (Fed. Cir. 1998); then citing McNutt v. GMAC, 298 U.S.\n 178, 188\u201389 (1936)).\n      On appeal, Mr. Torrez argues that the Veterans Court\n failed to presume service connection based on the medical\n evidence before it. As we explained in Walker, \u00a7 3.303(b)\n provides that service connection may be presumed when a\n disease or injury documented in service is chronic, or when\n the symptoms have continued since military service. 708\n F.3d at 1336. Considering this regulation, the Board found\n that the evidence presented did not show the required re-\n lationship or correlation between Mr. Torrez\u2019s injuries and\n his military service, and therefore concluded that Mr. Tor-\n rez was not entitled to a presumption of service connection.\n S.A. 19. The Veterans Court, in affirming the Board\u2019s de-\n cision, found no error in the Board\u2019s analysis of the facts\n and evidence presented. It did not rely on an incorrect in-\n terpretation of a statute or regulation in coming to its deci-\n sion, and Mr. Torrez does not identify any regulation or\n statute that the Veterans Court incorrectly interpreted.\n\fCase: 21-1081    Document: 36       Page: 7   Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n TORREZ   v. MCDONOUGH                                      7\n\n\n\n Rather, Mr. Torrez argues that the evidence presented to\n the Board shows he is entitled to a presumption of service\n connection for his injuries, which is a factual question that\n would require us to reweigh the medical evidence. Indeed,\n Mr. Torrez\u2019s arguments challenge only the weighing of the\n evidence. Because we lack jurisdiction to review the\n Board\u2019s and Veterans Court\u2019s assessment of the medical ev-\n idence, we dismiss. See Butler v. Shinseki, 603 F.3d 922,\n 926 (Fed. Cir. 2010).\n                         CONCLUSION\n     We have considered Mr. Torrez\u2019s remaining arguments\n but find them unpersuasive. For the foregoing reasons, we\n dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n                         DISMISSED\n                            COSTS\n No costs.\n\f",

The examining physician did\n not find any abnormalities in Mr. Torrez\u2019s back, knees, or\n elbows.\n     Following his discharge from the Army in 1991,\n Mr. Torrez filed a claim for service connection for bilateral\n elbow, bilateral knee, ankle, and lower back disabilities.\n\fCase: 21-1081     Document: 36      Page: 3    Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n TORREZ   v.

Mr. Torrez sought to reopen his knee claim in\n 2004, which the VA denied.\n     In 2016, Mr. Torrez filed a claim for an increased rat-\n ing for his right ankle and sought to reopen his service con-\n nection claims for his elbow, knee, and back conditions.

It ex-\n plained that \u201c[t]he four current conditions [that\n Mr. Torrez] has today appear to have developed sometime\n between his separation from service, and 2004.\u201d S.A. 19.\n As for his request for an increased rating for his right ankle\n disability, the Board found that Mr. Torrez was entitled to\n a 20-percent rating prior to November 2018, and a 10-per-\n cent rating after November 2018 because his November\n 2018 examination showed only moderate limitation in con-\n trast to his March 2016 examination, which showed\n marked limitation of motion.\n      Mr. Torrez appealed to the Veterans Court, which af-\n firmed the Board\u2019s decision. Torrez v. Wilkie, No. 19-5859,\n 2020 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1474 (Vet. App. July 31,\n 2020). The Veterans Court explained that \u201cestablishing\n service connection requires competent evidence (medical or\n lay, depending on the circumstances) of a current disabil-\n ity, an in-service incurrence of a disease or injury, and a\n link between the claimed disability and the in-service dis-\n ease or injury.\u201d Id. at *8 (citing Marcelino v. Shulkin,\n <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">29 Vet. App. 155<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 157 (2018)). Because Mr. Torrez was di-\n agnosed with various forms of arthritis, which the VA con-\n siders to be a chronic condition under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.309(a),\n the court explained that \u201cservice connection may be estab-\n lished on a presumptive basis through a showing of chro-\n nicity or continuity of symptomatology.\u201d Id. at *8\u20139 (citing\n Walker v. Shinskei, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">708 F.3d 1331<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1336 (Fed.

As to whether his symptoms were continu-\n ous, the court concluded that the Board did not err in\n finding that Mr. Torrez\u2019s in-service complaints resolved\n during his service and did not indicate chronic conditions.\n <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at *12<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n     The court also noted that the Board did not address\n Mr. Torrez\u2019s 1992 VA medical examination\u2014which did not\n show any disability of the knees, elbows, or back\u2014and that\n Mr. Torrez\u2019s medical records from the Wilford Hall Medical\n Center after 1992 were not relevant because they generally\n pertained to his ongoing heart condition. <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at *10<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201311.\n The court determined that the Board\u2019s conclusions were\n supported by the in-service treatment records and the No-\n vember 2018 examination because these additional records\n \u201cconfirm that he didn\u2019t have chronic disabilities within the\n presumptive period or don\u2019t reference his conditions at all.\u201d\n <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at *11<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n     The court then turned to Mr. Torrez\u2019s claim for in-\n creased rating for his ankle disability. Although the Vet-\n erans Court \u201cobserve[d] that the Board described the\n ranges of marked limitation and moderate limitation with-\n out specifying the origin of where those standards came\n from,\u201d it noted that the error was not prejudicial and would\n not have changed the outcome of the decision. <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.\n at *14<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">\u201315. Finally, the Veterans Court determined that\n Mr. Torrez \u201chas not identified any error in the Board\u2019s re-\n liance on the November 2018 exam to determine that he is\n entitled to 20% before November 2018 and 10% thereafter.\u201d\n\fCase: 21-1081     Document: 36     Page: 6    Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 6                                      TORREZ   v.

Considering this regulation, the Board found\n that the evidence presented did not show the required re-\n lationship or correlation between Mr. Torrez\u2019s injuries and\n his military service, and therefore concluded that Mr. Tor-\n rez was not entitled to a presumption of service connection.\n S.A. 19. The Veterans Court, in affirming the Board\u2019s de-\n cision, found no error in the Board\u2019s analysis of the facts\n and evidence presented. It did not rely on an incorrect in-\n terpretation of a statute or regulation in coming to its deci-\n sion, and Mr. Torrez does not identify any regulation or\n statute that the Veterans Court incorrectly interpreted.\n\fCase: 21-1081    Document: 36       Page: 7   Filed: 08\/03\/2021\n\n\n\n\n TORREZ   v.

Indeed,\n Mr. Torrez\u2019s arguments challenge only the weighing of the\n evidence. Because we lack jurisdiction to review the\n Board\u2019s and Veterans Court\u2019s assessment of the medical ev-\n idence, we dismiss. See Butler v.

(alteration in original) (quoting Volkswagen I,\n371 F.3d at 203).\n    In denying Hulu\u2019s motion for transfer, the district court\nat least erred in its analysis for each factor that it found\nweighed against transfer: (1) the availability of compul-\nsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses; (2) the\ncost of attendance for willing witnesses; and (3) the admin-\nistrative difficulties flowing from court congestion. We dis-\ncuss each in turn below.\n                              A\n    First, the district court erred in finding that the avail-\nability of compulsory process to secure the attendance of\nwitnesses weighed against transfer.\n    Hulu identified several CDNs and revenue sharing\ncontent partners that are located in California with many\nin the Central District of California. App. 77\u201378, 82. Fur-\nthermore, Hulu identified a significant number of potential\nprior art witnesses that were also based in California.\nApp. 82\u201383. On the other hand, SITO merely posited that\ncertain third-party witnesses that Hulu had identified\n(from Apple and Microsoft) may be subject to the compul-\nsory power of both the Western District of Texas and the\nCentral District of California. App. 231 (citing an attorney\ndeclaration relying on a location found on maps.bing.com,\nSupp. App. 16).\n    The district court did not dispute Hulu\u2019s contention\nthat the vast majority of witnesses to be analyzed under\nthis factor would be subject to the compulsory process of\nthe Central District of California. Instead, it determined\nthat this factor weighed against transfer by discounting\n\fCase: 21-142     Document: 23      Page: 6     Filed: 08\/02\/2021\n\n\n\n\n6                                               IN RE: HULU, LLC\n\n\n\n\nHulu\u2019s proposed prior art witnesses and by faulting Hulu\nfor \u201cnot show[ing] [that] any potential witness is unwilling\nto testify\u201d other than one of the specifically identified prior\nart witnesses.

This was\nerror for several reasons.\n     First, even assuming the district court had properly\ndiscounted Hulu\u2019s proposed witnesses, the evidence before\nthe district court showed, at best, only two potential Hulu\nprior art witnesses that would be subject to compulsory\nprocess by the Western District of Texas in addition to the\nCentral District of California. Thus, this factor would be\nat most neutral, and certainly not weighing against trans-\nfer.\n    Second, the district court erred by entirely overlooking\nHulu\u2019s multiple CDN witnesses who Hulu alleged, without\ndispute, would have knowledge of Hulu\u2019s allegedly infring-\ning systems and processes and were located in California.\nApp. 82; see also App. 77\u201378. Thus, even if the district\ncourt were correct that prior art witnesses could be dis-\ncounted, that rationale would not apply to these witnesses,\nwhom the district court failed to mention in analyzing this\nfactor. See In re Apple, Inc., 581 F. App\u2019x 886, 888\u201389\n(Fed. Cir. 2014) (granting mandamus where the district\ncourt \u201cignored the relevant evidence\u201d by \u201cfail[ing] to men-\ntion the five other witnesses identified\u201d). Thus, even if the\nprior art witnesses were neutral for this factor, the addi-\ntional consideration of these CDN witnesses would push\nthis factor toward favoring transfer.\n    Third, the district court erred by ignoring all of Hulu\u2019s\nproposed prior art witnesses for the reason that \u201cprior art\nwitnesses are generally unlikely to testify at trial . . . .\u201d Or-\nder, 2021 WL 1166772, at *5. This categorical rejection of\nHulu\u2019s witnesses is entirely untethered to the facts of this\ncase and therefore was an abuse of discretion. See In re\nBiosearch Techs., Inc., 452 F. App\u2019x 986, 987 (Fed. Cir.\n2011) (\u201cA motion to transfer under \u00a7 1404(a) calls upon the\n\fCase: 21-142       Document: 23   Page: 7    Filed: 08\/02\/2021\n\n\n\n\nIN RE: HULU, LLC                                             7\n\n\n\ntrial court to weigh a number of case-specific factors based\non the individualized facts on record.\u201d). Here, certain of\nHulu\u2019s proposed prior art witnesses directly related to prior\nart that was specifically mentioned in the asserted patents\nthemselves, heightening their potential relevance.\nApp. 86. The district court provided no analysis whatso-\never to cast doubt that these particular prior art witnesses\nwould play a role in an upcoming trial other than specula-\ntion that they would be \u201cunlikely to testify at trial\u201d because\ngenerally prior art witnesses do not do so. Order, 2021 WL\n1166772, at *5. Such a bare and generalized analysis can-\nnot be said to be providing \u201cindividualized, case-by-case\nconsideration\u201d of the relevant factors, as is required for the\nanalysis of a \u00a7 1404(a) motion. Van Dusen v. Barrack,\n376 U.S. 612, 622 (1964). Furthermore, we have cautioned\nthat \u201c[r]equiring a defendant to show that the potential\nwitness has more than relevant and material information\nat this point in the litigation or risk facing denial of trans-\nfer on that basis is unnecessary.\u201d In re Genentech, Inc.,\n566 F.3d 1338, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The district court\nabused its discretion in zeroing out the weight of these wit-\nnesses without any case-specific analysis.\n     Finally, the district court erred in discounting Hulu\u2019s\nproposed witnesses because \u201cHulu has not shown any po-\ntential witness is unwilling to testify [in the Western Dis-\ntrict of Texas], other than Mr. Newton . . . .\u201d Order,\n2021 WL 1166772, at *5. In doing so, the district court re-\nlied on precedent from a different circuit regarding dismis-\nsal for forum non conveniens, id. (citing Duha v. Agrium,\nInc., 448 F.3d 867, 877 (6th Cir. 2006)), which is held to a\nhigher standard of inconvenience, Volkswagen II, 545 F.3d\nat 314 (\u201c[section] 1404(a) venue transfers may be granted\nupon a lesser showing of inconvenience than forum non\nconveniens dismissals\u201d) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). We are not inclined to think that the Fifth Circuit\nwould adopt this position in this case. To the contrary, we\nthink that the Fifth Circuit would recognize that where, as\n\fCase: 21-142    Document: 23     Page: 8    Filed: 08\/02\/2021\n\n\n\n\n8                                            IN RE: HULU, LLC\n\n\n\n\nhere, the movant has identified multiple third-party wit-\nnesses and shown that they are overwhelmingly located\nwithin the subpoena power of only the transferee venue,\nthis factor favors transfer even without a showing of un-\nwillingness for each witness. See, e.g., In re HP Inc.,\n2018 WL 4692486, at *3 n.1 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 25, 2018) (not-\ning that at least one case from the Eastern District of Texas\nhas applied a presumption of unwillingness \u201cwhen there is\nno indication that a non-party witness is willing\u201d). Here,\nthere is no indication that the third-party witnesses iden-\ntified by Hulu would be willing, and the vast majority are\nsubject to the compulsory process in the Central District of\nCalifornia.\n    Overall, comparing the availability of compulsory pro-\ncess to secure the attendance of witnesses in the two fo-\nrums, we determine that this factor favors transfer. At the\nvery minimum, the district court erred in finding the factor\nweighed against transfer, rather than being neutral. Noth-\ning in the district court\u2019s analysis showed a comparative\nadvantage of the Western District of Texas over the Cen-\ntral District of California. At best, as the district court\nmentioned, two potential prior art witnesses would be\nequally subject to the compulsory process in both forums.\nAll other things being equal, this might have rendered this\nfactor neutral. But all else was not equal because many\nother third-party witnesses were only subject to the com-\npulsory power of the transferee venue, and the evidence\nheavily favored Hulu. Thus, this factor favors transfer. 2\n\n\n\n\n    2    Hulu objects to the district court\u2019s statement that\n\u201cHulu has not shown transfer is clearly more convenient\nfor all of its non-party witnesses\u201d as it applies to the com-\npulsory process factor. Order, 2021 WL 1166772, at *5. We\nagree that this statement seems to be out of place for this\nfactor. Unlike the willing witness factor, the compulsory\n\fCase: 21-142       Document: 23    Page: 9    Filed: 08\/02\/2021\n\n\n\n\nIN RE: HULU, LLC                                              9\n\n\n\n                               B\n     We next turn to the district court\u2019s analysis of the will-\ning witness factor. The district court recognized that this\nis \u201cthe most important factor in a \u00a7 1404(a) analysis.\u201d Or-\nder, 2021 WL 1166772, at *5 (citing Genentech, 566 F.3d\nat 1342). The district court also acknowledged that \u201c[i]f a\nsubstantial number of witnesses reside in one venue and\nno witnesses reside in another, th[is] factor will weigh in\nfavor of the venue where witnesses reside.\u201d Id. (citing\nGenentech, 566 F.3d at 1345). Even though that is pre-\ncisely the case here, the district court still found this factor\nweighed against transfer for two reasons. Id. at *6. \u201cFirst,\nthe convenience of party witnesses is typically given little\nweight because the witnesses\u2019 employer could compel their\ntestimony at trial.\u201d Id. Second, Hulu failed to \u201cidentify\nspecific third-party witnesses.\u201d Id. We conclude that the\ndistrict court erred in its analysis.\n     First, the district court did not dispute Hulu\u2019s conten-\ntion that nearly all of the party witnesses are in or near the\nCentral District of California. App. 76\u201377, 250 n.2, 258,\n264\u201365. And in analyzing the parties\u2019 arguments, the dis-\ntrict court could identify no witnesses within the Western\nDistrict of Texas, instead relying entirely on discounting\nall of Hulu\u2019s witnesses located in or near the Central\n\n\n\nprocess factor is more about the convenience of the litigat-\ning parties in making their case rather than the conven-\nience of the unwilling witnesses compelled to testify.\nFurthermore, to the extent that this statement could have\nindicated that transfer is inappropriate unless the trans-\nferee forum is \u201cmore convenient for all of [the movant\u2019s]\nnon-party witnesses,\u201d id. (emphasis added), this too would\nbe erroneous, see Genentech, 566 F.3d at 1345. However,\nwe do not read this sentence as the actual basis for the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s decision as to this factor.\n\fCase: 21-142     Document: 23      Page: 10    Filed: 08\/02\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 10                                            IN RE: HULU, LLC\n\n\n\n\n District of California. Even if the district court were cor-\n rect that Hulu\u2019s witnesses could be completely discounted,\n and the district court only considered SITO\u2019s employees, it\n was unrebutted that five out of six of SITO\u2019s own full-time\n employees were located in California, thus tipping this fac-\n tor toward favoring transfer because the district court did\n not rely on any witnesses that would have found the West-\n ern District of Texas to be more convenient. Thus, at a\n minimum, it was error to find this factor weighed against\n transfer. See TracFone, 2021 WL 1546036, at *2 (deter-\n mining that the district court erred in its analysis of the\n willing witness factor where \u201cseveral of [movant\u2019s] likely\n employee witnesses resid[e] in the transferee venue and\n [the district court did not] rely[] on the location of a single\n potential witness within or even close to Waco, Texas\u201d).\n      Second, the district court erred in entirely discounting\n Hulu\u2019s party witnesses located in the transferee venue be-\n cause, according to the district court, Hulu \u201ccould compel\n their testimony at trial.\u201d Order, 2021 WL 1166772, at *6.\n Although an employer\u2019s cooperation in allowing an em-\n ployee to testify may diminish certain aspects of inconven-\n ience to the employee witness (for instance, the employee\n is not acting contrary to their employer\u2019s wishes), it hardly\n eliminates the inconvenience. As this court has recognized,\n \u201cit generally becomes more inconvenient and costly for wit-\n nesses to attend trial the further they are away from\n home[.]\u201d Genentech, 566 F.3d at 1343 (citing Volkswagen\n II, 545 F.3d at 317); see also Volkswagen I, 371 F.3d at 205\n (considering the amount of \u201ctime which these fact wit-\n nesses must be away from their regular employment\u201d).\n This is true even if the employer allows for their testimony.\n The district court\u2019s analysis discounting the inconvenience\n to Hulu\u2019s witnesses is fundamentally at odds with the pur-\n pose of a transfer for convenience of the witnesses, and it\n conflicts with the district court\u2019s own recognition that \u201ca\n court must consider the factor of inconvenience to all\n\fCase: 21-142    Document: 23      Page: 11   Filed: 08\/02\/2021\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: HULU, LLC                                          11\n\n\n\n witnesses.\u201d Order, 2021 WL 1166772, at *6 (citing Genen-\n tech, 566 F.3d at 1342).\n      Finally, the two potential witnesses identified by SITO\n located in Texas would not change our conclusion as to this\n factor. SITO\u2019s opposition to Hulu\u2019s motion to transfer iden-\n tified Don Bate, a named inventor of the asserted patents,\n and Aaric Eisenstein, a licensee of the asserted patents, as\n potential witnesses that are located in Texas (with only Mr.\n Eisenstein in the Western District). App. 233\u201334. Alt-\n hough the district court acknowledged this argument by\n SITO, Order, 2021 WL 1166772, at *6, 3 the district court\n did not credit these specific witnesses (or mention them) in\n its analysis. At worst, this would render this factor neu-\n tral, but given the overwhelming number of potential wit-\n nesses from Hulu in or near California compared to the two\n from SITO in Texas, we determine that this factor favors\n transfer.\n                              C\n      As to the last factor that the district court found\n weighed against transfer\u2014court congestion\u2014the statistics\n presented to the court regarding the two forums were re-\n markably similar. See Order, 2021 WL 1166772, at *8. The\n consideration that the district court assumed tipped the\n scales toward denying transfer was its own ability to set an\n early trial date and bring a case to trial earlier than dis-\n trict-wide statistics would suggest. Id.\n     This was error for precisely the same reason described\n in In re Apple Inc., 979 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2020). In\n\n\n     3   We note that the district court cited SITO\u2019s re-\n sponse at 19\u201320, but this portion does not discuss willing\n witnesses. See App. 237\u201338. Based on the sentence pre-\n ceding the citation, we assume the district court meant to\n cite SITO\u2019s response at 15\u201316 (App. 233\u201334), which dis-\n cusses SITO\u2019s witnesses.\n\fCase: 21-142     Document: 23       Page: 12   Filed: 08\/02\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 12                                            IN RE: HULU, LLC\n\n\n\n\n granting mandamus directing the district court to transfer\n in Apple, we determined that the district court \u201cmisapplied\n the law to the facts of th[e] case by relying too heavily on\n the scheduled trial date,\u201d explaining that \u201ca court\u2019s general\n ability to set a fast-paced schedule is not particularly rele-\n vant to\u201d the court congestion factor. Id. at 1344 (citing In\n re Adobe Inc., 823 F. App\u2019x 929, 932 (Fed. Cir. 2020)). Thus,\n considering the close similarity of cases per judgeship and\n average time to trial of the two forums, and disregarding\n the particular district court\u2019s ability to push an aggressive\n trial date, this factor is neutral. And even if the balance of\n this factor had tipped slightly against transfer, this slight\n imbalance alone would not have been enough to tip the\n scales in favor of denying transfer. See Apple, 979 F.3d\n at 1344 n.5 (citing Genentech, 566 F.3d at 1347).\n                            *   *   *\n     After correcting these errors by the district court, no\n factors remain that weigh against transfer and several\n weigh in favor. 4 Thus, we readily conclude that the district\n court clearly abused its discretion in denying Hulu\u2019s trans-\n fer motion. Given that conclusion, we grant Hulu\u2019s petition\n for mandamus.\n      Accordingly,\n      IT IS ORDERED THAT:\n\n\n\n\n      4   Although the district court found that the \u201clocal in-\n terest\u201d factor weighed slightly in favor of transfer, Order,\n 2021 WL 1166772 at *8\u20139, we caution the district court\n that \u201c[l]ocal interests are not a fiction,\u201d In re Samsung Elec-\n tronics Co., Ltd., 2021 WL 2672136, at *7 (Fed.

We dis-\ncuss each in turn below.\n                              A\n    First, the district court erred in finding that the avail-\nability of compulsory process to secure the attendance of\nwitnesses weighed against transfer.\n    Hulu identified several CDNs and revenue sharing\ncontent partners that are located in California with many\nin the Central District of California. App. 77\u201378, 82. Fur-\nthermore, Hulu identified a significant number of potential\nprior art witnesses that were also based in California.\nApp. 82\u201383. On the other hand, SITO merely posited that\ncertain third-party witnesses that Hulu had identified\n(from Apple and Microsoft) may be subject to the compul-\nsory power of both the Western District of Texas and the\nCentral District of California. App. 231 (citing an attorney\ndeclaration relying on a location found on maps.bing.com,\nSupp. App. 16).\n    The district court did not dispute Hulu\u2019s contention\nthat the vast majority of witnesses to be analyzed under\nthis factor would be subject to the compulsory process of\nthe Central District of California. Instead, it determined\nthat this factor weighed against transfer by discounting\n\fCase: 21-142     Document: 23      Page: 6     Filed: 08\/02\/2021\n\n\n\n\n6                                               IN RE: HULU, LLC\n\n\n\n\nHulu\u2019s proposed prior art witnesses and by faulting Hulu\nfor \u201cnot show[ing] [that] any potential witness is unwilling\nto testify\u201d other than one of the specifically identified prior\nart witnesses. Order, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 WL 1166772<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. This was\nerror for several reasons.\n     First, even assuming the district court had properly\ndiscounted Hulu\u2019s proposed witnesses, the evidence before\nthe district court showed, at best, only two potential Hulu\nprior art witnesses that would be subject to compulsory\nprocess by the Western District of Texas in addition to the\nCentral District of California. Thus, this factor would be\nat most neutral, and certainly not weighing against trans-\nfer.\n    Second, the district court erred by entirely overlooking\nHulu\u2019s multiple CDN witnesses who Hulu alleged, without\ndispute, would have knowledge of Hulu\u2019s allegedly infring-\ning systems and processes and were located in California.\nApp. 82; see also App. 77\u201378. Thus, even if the district\ncourt were correct that prior art witnesses could be dis-\ncounted, that rationale would not apply to these witnesses,\nwhom the district court failed to mention in analyzing this\nfactor. See In re Apple, Inc., 581 F. App\u2019x 886, 888\u201389\n(Fed. Cir. 2014) (granting mandamus where the district\ncourt \u201cignored the relevant evidence\u201d by \u201cfail[ing] to men-\ntion the five other witnesses identified\u201d). Thus, even if the\nprior art witnesses were neutral for this factor, the addi-\ntional consideration of these CDN witnesses would push\nthis factor toward favoring transfer.\n    Third, the district court erred by ignoring all of Hulu\u2019s\nproposed prior art witnesses for the reason that \u201cprior art\nwitnesses are generally unlikely to testify at trial . . . .\u201d Or-\nder, <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 WL 1166772<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5.

Here,\nthere is no indication that the third-party witnesses iden-\ntified by Hulu would be willing, and the vast majority are\nsubject to the compulsory process in the Central District of\nCalifornia.\n    Overall, comparing the availability of compulsory pro-\ncess to secure the attendance of witnesses in the two fo-\nrums, we determine that this factor favors transfer. At the\nvery minimum, the district court erred in finding the factor\nweighed against transfer, rather than being neutral. Noth-\ning in the district court\u2019s analysis showed a comparative\nadvantage of the Western District of Texas over the Cen-\ntral District of California.

Based on the sentence pre-\n ceding the citation, we assume the district court meant to\n cite SITO\u2019s response at 15\u201316 (App. 233\u201334), which dis-\n cusses SITO\u2019s witnesses.\n\fCase: 21-142     Document: 23       Page: 12   Filed: 08\/02\/2021\n\n\n\n\n 12                                            IN RE: HULU, LLC\n\n\n\n\n granting mandamus directing the district court to transfer\n in Apple, we determined that the district court \u201cmisapplied\n the law to the facts of th[e] case by relying too heavily on\n the scheduled trial date,\u201d explaining that \u201ca court\u2019s general\n ability to set a fast-paced schedule is not particularly rele-\n vant to\u201d the court congestion factor. <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 1344<\/span><pre class=\"inline\"> (citing In\n re Adobe Inc., 823 F. App\u2019x 929, 932 (Fed. Cir. 2020)). Thus,\n considering the close similarity of cases per judgeship and\n average time to trial of the two forums, and disregarding\n the particular district court\u2019s ability to push an aggressive\n trial date, this factor is neutral. And even if the balance of\n this factor had tipped slightly against transfer, this slight\n imbalance alone would not have been enough to tip the\n scales in favor of denying transfer. See Apple, 979 F.3d\n at 1344 n.5 (citing Genentech, <\/pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"208674\"><a href=\"\/opinion\/208674\/in-re-genentech-inc\/\">566 F.3d at 1347<\/a><\/span><pre class=\"inline\">).\n                            *   *   *\n     After correcting these errors by the district court, no\n factors remain that weigh against transfer and several\n weigh in favor. 4 Thus, we readily conclude that the district\n court clearly abused its discretion in denying Hulu\u2019s trans-\n fer motion. Given that conclusion, we grant Hulu\u2019s petition\n for mandamus.\n      Accordingly,\n      IT IS ORDERED THAT:\n\n\n\n\n      4   Although the district court found that the \u201clocal in-\n terest\u201d factor weighed slightly in favor of transfer, Order,\n <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 WL 1166772<\/span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *8\u20139, we caution the district court\n that \u201c[l]ocal interests are not a fiction,\u201d In re Samsung Elec-\n tronics Co., Ltd., <\/pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 WL 2672136<\/span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (Fed.

To the extent that the district court discounted\n the local interest factor based on this reasoning, this was\n also an error.\n\fCase: 21-142    Document: 23      Page: 13    Filed: 08\/02\/2021\n\n\n\n\n IN RE: HULU, LLC                                            13\n\n\n\n     Hulu\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus is granted.
